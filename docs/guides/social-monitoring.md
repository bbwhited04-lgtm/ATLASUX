# Social Monitoring

Social Monitoring gives you real-time listening, alerts, and sentiment tracking across your social media presence.

## Opening Social Monitoring

Click **Social Monitoring** in the sidebar or navigate to `/app/monitoring`.

## Overview

The Social Monitoring page provides a dashboard with:

- **Alerts count** -- How many social alerts need your attention
- **Sentiment score** -- An aggregate sentiment measure across platforms
- **Mentions count** -- Total mentions of your brand or tracked keywords
- **Sources count** -- How many platforms are being monitored

## Tabs

The monitoring interface has several tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | High-level stats and summary cards |
| **Mentions** | Individual mentions from social platforms |
| **Sentiment** | Sentiment analysis charts and trends |
| **Alerts** | Triggered alerts that need review |

## Starting a Listening Session

1. Click the **Start Listening** button in the top right corner.
2. The system will queue a listening job that scans connected social platforms for mentions, sentiment, and activity.
3. The button changes to red ("Stop Listening") while active.

**Important:** You must have a business selected before starting a listening session. If no business is selected, you will see a prompt to go to Business Manager first.

### Connected Providers

Listening works best when you have social platform integrations connected. If some providers are not connected, you will see a warning listing which ones are missing. Go to **Settings > Integrations** to connect them.

## Alerts

Click the **Alerts** button in the header to view and manage triggered alerts. Alerts are generated when:
- A negative sentiment spike is detected
- An unusual volume of mentions occurs
- Specific keywords or competitor names appear

## Sentiment Tracking

The sentiment tab breaks down your social mentions into:
- **Positive** -- Favorable mentions, praise, recommendations
- **Neutral** -- Informational or factual mentions
- **Negative** -- Complaints, criticism, or negative feedback

This helps you quickly spot issues and respond before they escalate.

## Platform Coverage

Social Monitoring can track activity across all platforms you have connected through integrations, including:
- X (Twitter)
- Facebook
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- TikTok
- Tumblr
- Pinterest

## Tips

- Connect all your social accounts in Settings to get comprehensive monitoring.
- Check alerts daily to catch issues early.
- Use sentiment trends to measure the impact of marketing campaigns.
- Social monitoring data feeds into your agents' intelligence, helping them make better decisions.
