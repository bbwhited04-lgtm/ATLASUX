# Agents Hub

The Agents Hub is where you can view your entire AI workforce -- every agent, their role, reporting hierarchy, authority, constraints, and tools.

## Opening the Agents Hub

Click **Agents** in the sidebar or navigate to `/app/agents`.

## Understanding the Agent Roster

Atlas UX operates with a structured hierarchy of AI agents. Each agent has a defined role, just like employees in a company:

### Executive Team
- **Atlas** -- CEO, the top-level orchestrator
- **Binky** -- CRO (Chief Revenue Officer), manages growth and publishing

### Governors and Specialists
- **Tina** -- CFO, financial oversight
- **Larry** -- Governor, operational support
- **Jenny** -- CLO (Chief Legal Officer)
- **Benny** -- Intellectual Property specialist
- **Cheryl** -- Customer Support

### Content and Social Team
- **Sunday** -- Communications and technical documentation
- **Kelly** (X/Twitter), **Fran** (Facebook), **Dwight** (Threads), **Timmy** (TikTok), **Terry** (Tumblr), **Cornwall** (Pinterest), **Link** (LinkedIn), **Emma** (Alignable), **Donna** (Reddit), **Reynolds** (Blog), **Penny** (Facebook Ads / multi-platform)

### Operations
- **Venny** -- Image Production, **Victor** -- Video Production
- **Petra** -- Project Management, **Sandy** -- Bookings
- **Frank** -- Forms, **Porter** -- SharePoint, **Claire** -- Calendar
- **Mercer** -- Acquisition, **Archy** -- Research, **Daily-Intel** -- Intelligence

## Browsing Agents by View

The Agents Hub has tabs across the top to filter your view:

| Tab | What It Shows |
|-----|--------------|
| **Atlas** | Atlas (CEO) and direct reports |
| **Binky** | Binky (CRO) and the publishing/social team |
| **Board** | Board-level agents (Chairman) |
| **All** | Every agent in one list |
| **Tools** | Tools available to agents |
| **Workflows** | Registered workflows |
| **Deployment** | Agent deployment settings |
| **Automation** | Task automation configuration |
| **Engines** | Decision engine settings |

## Agent Cards

Each agent is displayed as a card showing:

- **Tier** -- Board, Executive, Governor, or Specialist
- **Name and Title** -- The agent's name and job title
- **Reports To** -- Who this agent reports to in the hierarchy
- **Summary** -- A brief description of what the agent does
- **Authority** -- What this agent is allowed to do
- **Constraints** -- What this agent is NOT allowed to do
- **Primary Outputs** -- The types of work this agent produces
- **Tools Allowed / Forbidden** -- Specific tools the agent can or cannot use

## Searching for Agents

Use the search bar at the top right to filter agents by name, title, role, or any keyword in their description, authority, or constraints.

## Tips

- Use the "All" tab to get a complete picture of your workforce.
- Check an agent's constraints to understand what safety limits are in place.
- The hierarchy matters: agents escalate decisions up the chain when they hit their authority limits.
