# Getting Started with Atlas UX

This guide walks you through accessing Atlas UX for the first time, entering your access code, and finding your way around the platform.

## What is Atlas UX?

Atlas UX is an AI employee productivity platform. It gives you a team of AI agents that can automate business tasks like sending emails, writing blog posts, monitoring social media, and managing workflows -- all with built-in safety guardrails and human approval workflows.

## Accessing the Platform

Atlas UX is available in three ways:

1. **Web app** -- Visit the Atlas UX website and click "Open ATLAS UX (Preview)" on the landing page.
2. **Desktop app** -- Download the Tauri-based desktop app for Windows, macOS, or Linux. See the [Desktop App guide](./desktop-app.md).
3. **Mobile app** -- A companion mobile app is coming soon. See the [Mobile App guide](./mobile-app.md).

## Entering Your Access Code

Atlas UX is currently in private beta. When you open the app for the first time, you will see a "Private Beta" screen asking for an access code.

1. Enter the access code you received from your administrator or invitation email.
2. Click **Continue** (or press Enter).
3. If the code is correct, you will be taken directly to the dashboard.

Your access is stored for the current browser session. If you close the browser and reopen it, you will need to enter the code again.

**Note:** After five incorrect attempts, you will be temporarily locked out for 30 seconds. This is a security measure to prevent brute-force guessing.

## Choosing Your Business (Tenant)

Atlas UX supports multiple businesses (called "tenants") under one account. When you first log in:

1. Navigate to **Business Manager** from the sidebar.
2. You will see a list of available businesses. Click on one to select it.
3. Your selected business is remembered across the app. All data (jobs, agents, files, etc.) is scoped to this business.

You can switch businesses at any time by returning to Business Manager and selecting a different one.

## Navigating the Sidebar

Once inside the app, you will see a sidebar on the left with these main sections:

- **Dashboard** -- Your home screen with KPI cards and recent activity
- **Chat** -- Talk to AI agents
- **Agents** -- View the agent roster and hierarchy
- **Jobs** -- Monitor and create jobs
- **Business Manager** -- Manage businesses, assets, budgets, decisions, and blog
- **CRM** -- Customer relationship management
- **Social Monitoring** -- Social listening and sentiment tracking
- **Knowledge Base** -- Documents your agents can reference
- **Messaging** -- Telegram, Teams, email, and SMS
- **Agent Watcher** -- Live agent activity feed
- **Settings** -- Integrations, API keys, file management, and profile

The sidebar can be collapsed by clicking the chevron arrow at the top to give you more screen space.

## Setting Atlas Online

In the top header bar, you will see an Atlas status indicator showing whether the AI engine is online or offline. Click it to toggle the engine on or off. When online, agents can autonomously process jobs and workflows.

## What to Do Next

- Explore the [Dashboard](./dashboard.md) to see your KPI summary.
- Try [chatting with an agent](./chat-interface.md).
- Browse the [Agents Hub](./agents-hub.md) to see who is on your AI team.
- Set up [integrations](./settings.md) to connect Google, Microsoft, or social accounts.

Welcome aboard. Your AI workforce is ready.
