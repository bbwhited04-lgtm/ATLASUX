# Freelancer & Solopreneur Workflows

How a one-person operation deploys Atlas UX as a full team. This document maps daily routines, weekly cycles, and agent responsibilities for solo operators who need enterprise capabilities on a solo budget.

## The Solo Problem

A freelancer or solopreneur wears every hat: CEO, accountant, marketer, salesperson, customer support, project manager, and content creator. Research shows solo operators spend only 30-40% of their time on revenue-generating work. The rest goes to admin, marketing, and operations they are not trained for.

Atlas UX changes the ratio. With AI employees handling operations, a solopreneur can spend 80%+ of their time on their core skill — the thing clients actually pay for.

## Your AI Team Structure

As a solopreneur, you interact primarily with Atlas (CEO). Atlas coordinates the rest of the team on your behalf. You do not need to manage 25+ agents individually.

**Executive Layer (strategic decisions):**
- **Atlas (CEO):** Your strategic partner. Reviews priorities, makes resource allocation decisions, escalates only critical items to you.
- **Binky (CRO):** Finds growth opportunities. Identifies which services to promote, which markets to enter, which clients to upsell.

**Finance and Compliance:**
- **Tina (CFO):** Tracks income and expenses, categorizes transactions, monitors budgets, prepares tax-relevant reports.
- **Larry (Auditor):** Maintains audit trail of all automated actions. Your compliance safety net.
- **Jenny (Legal):** Reviews contracts, terms, and compliance requirements.
- **Benny (IP):** Protects your intellectual property and monitors for infringement.

**Client-Facing:**
- **Cheryl (Support):** Handles inbound client communications. Responds to questions, routes issues, follows up on outstanding items.
- **Sandy (Bookings):** Manages your calendar for client meetings, discovery calls, and project kickoffs.
- **Claire (Calendar):** Coordinates scheduling across all commitments.
- **Frank (Forms):** Captures intake forms, questionnaires, and client onboarding data.

**Marketing and Content:**
- **Sunday (Comms Writer):** Writes all marketing copy, email campaigns, and content strategy.
- **Reynolds (Blog):** Publishes blog content for SEO and thought leadership.
- **Social Publishers:** Kelly (X), Fran (Facebook), Link (LinkedIn), Timmy (TikTok), Cornwall (Pinterest), Donna (Reddit), Dwight (Threads), Terry (Tumblr), Emma (Alignable).
- **Venny (Images):** Produces visual content for all platforms.
- **Victor (Video):** Produces video content.
- **Penny (Ads):** Manages paid advertising across platforms.

**Growth and Intelligence:**
- **Mercer (Acquisition):** Runs outbound prospecting and lead generation.
- **Archy (Research):** Researches markets, competitors, and opportunities.
