# Employment Law & HR Compliance

## Purpose
This document provides Atlas UX agents with comprehensive employment law knowledge for making compliant decisions in hiring, workforce management, compensation, and workplace policy. Jenny (CLO), Larry (Auditor), and Atlas (CEO) must apply these principles when the platform handles any employment-related operations.

## 1. At-Will Employment

The default rule in 49 states (Montana being the exception after a probationary period): either employer or employee may terminate the relationship at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. However, at-will employment is subject to significant exceptions.

### 1.1 Statutory Exceptions
Termination is unlawful if motivated by discrimination based on a protected class (Title VII, ADA, ADEA), retaliation for exercising legal rights (filing a workers' comp claim, whistleblowing), or violation of specific statutes (WARN Act, FMLA).

### 1.2 Common Law Exceptions
- **Implied contract exception**: employee handbooks, oral promises, or course of dealing may create an implied contract limiting termination to "for cause." Disclaimers in handbooks help but are not always dispositive (Toussaint v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 1980).
- **Public policy exception**: termination is wrongful if it violates a clear mandate of public policy (e.g., firing an employee for refusing to commit perjury, for filing a workers' compensation claim, or for serving on a jury).
- **Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing**: recognized in a minority of states (e.g., California, Massachusetts). Prevents termination to avoid paying earned benefits.

## 2. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

### 2.1 Protected Classes
Race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity per Bostock v. Clayton County, 2020), and national origin. Applies to employers with 15 or more employees.

### 2.2 Disparate Treatment
Intentional discrimination. Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case (McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, 1973): (1) member of protected class, (2) qualified for the position, (3) suffered adverse employment action, (4) circumstances give rise to inference of discrimination. Burden shifts to employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Plaintiff then must show the reason is pretextual.

### 2.3 Disparate Impact
Facially neutral employment practice that disproportionately affects a protected group (Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971). Plaintiff shows statistical disparity. Employer must demonstrate the practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Plaintiff can still prevail by showing a less discriminatory alternative exists.

### 2.4 Harassment
Title VII prohibits harassment based on any protected class. Two forms: **quid pro quo** (submission to unwelcome conduct is made a condition of employment benefits) and **hostile work environment** (conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter conditions of employment — Harris v. Forklift Systems, 1993). Employer liability framework (Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 1998; Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, 1998): employer is vicariously liable for supervisor harassment resulting in tangible employment action; for other harassment, employer may assert affirmative defense (reasonable care to prevent/correct; employee unreasonably failed to use complaint procedures).

## 3. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. Applies to employers with 15+ employees. **Disability**: physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such impairment. **Qualified individual**: can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. **Reasonable accommodation**: modifications that enable performance unless they impose an undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense relative to employer size and resources). Interactive process required. Prohibition on pre-employment medical inquiries and examinations (post-offer exams permitted if required of all entering employees in the same job category).

---

## 4. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)

Protects individuals aged 40 and older from employment discrimination. Applies to employers with 20+ employees. Covers hiring, firing, compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges. Mixed-motive claims are more limited than under Title VII (Gross v. FBL Financial Services, 2009 — plaintiff must prove age was the "but-for" cause). Bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) defense is narrow. Voluntary early retirement incentives are permissible if truly voluntary and comply with the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA).

---

## 5. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

Provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for: birth/adoption/foster placement, serious health condition of the employee, serious health condition of a spouse/child/parent, or qualifying military exigency. **Eligibility**: employed for 12 months, worked 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months, employer has 50+ employees within 75 miles. **Key requirements**: employer must maintain health insurance; employee must be restored to the same or equivalent position; intermittent leave is available for serious health conditions. Military caregiver leave: up to 26 weeks for care of a covered servicemember.

---

## 6. Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

### 6.1 Minimum Wage and Overtime
Federal minimum wage: $7.25/hour (many states and localities set higher rates). Non-exempt employees must receive overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate for hours exceeding 40 in a workweek. Overtime is based on the workweek, not the day (except in California). Regular rate includes most forms of compensation (base pay, non-discretionary bonuses, shift differentials).

### 6.2 Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Classification
Three tests must be met for exemption: (1) **salary basis** — paid a predetermined, fixed salary not subject to reduction based on quality or quantity of work, (2) **salary level** — minimum $684/week ($35,568/year; note: DOL has proposed increases), (3) **duties test** — primary duty meets one of the white-collar exemptions:
- **Executive**: manages the enterprise or a recognized department; directs the work of two or more employees; has authority to hire/fire or recommendations carry particular weight.
- **Administrative**: office or non-manual work directly related to management or general business operations; exercises discretion and independent judgment on significant matters.
- **Professional**: work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged specialized instruction (learned professional) or work requiring invention, imagination, or talent in a recognized creative field (creative professional).
- **Computer employee**: systems analyst, programmer, software engineer; can be paid hourly at $27.63+.
- **Outside sales**: regularly engaged away from the employer's place of business; primary duty is making sales or obtaining contracts.

Misclassification exposes employers to back wages, liquidated damages (equal to back wages), and attorney's fees.

## 7. Worker Classification: Employee vs. Independent Contractor

### 7.1 IRS Common Law Test (20 Factors)
Examines three categories: **behavioral control** (does the company control how the work is done?), **financial control** (business aspects such as profit/loss opportunity, significant investment, expense reimbursement), and **type of relationship** (written contracts, benefits, permanency, integral nature of services). No single factor is determinative.

### 7.2 ABC Test
Increasingly adopted (California AB5, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois). A worker is an employee unless the hiring entity establishes: (A) the worker is free from control and direction in performing the work, (B) the work is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business, and (C) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. The B-prong is the most restrictive and captures many gig economy workers.

### 7.3 Economic Reality Test (DOL / FLSA)
Used for FLSA purposes. Examines: degree of control, worker's opportunity for profit or loss, worker's investment in equipment, permanence of the relationship, degree of skill required, integral nature of the service. Focuses on economic dependence.

### 7.4 Misclassification Consequences
Back taxes (employer portion of FICA, FUTA), penalties, back wages and overtime, benefits liability, state unemployment insurance, workers' compensation exposure, and potential class/collective action liability.

## 8. Non-Compete Agreements

### 8.1 Traditional Framework
Non-competes are enforceable in most states if reasonable in scope (activities restricted), duration (typically 1-2 years), and geographic area. Must protect a legitimate business interest (trade secrets, customer relationships, specialized training). Consideration required (continued employment may suffice in some states; additional consideration required in others). Courts may reform overly broad non-competes (blue-pencil doctrine) or refuse to enforce entirely.

### 8.2 FTC Non-Compete Ban
The FTC issued a final rule in April 2024 banning most non-competes. The rule faced judicial challenges (Ryan LLC v. FTC, N.D. Tex. 2024 — nationwide injunction). As of this writing, the rule's enforceability remains uncertain. Agents should monitor for final resolution. Several states (California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Minnesota) already ban or severely restrict non-competes.

### 8.3 Alternatives to Non-Competes
Non-solicitation agreements (restricting solicitation of clients/employees), non-disclosure agreements, garden leave provisions (paying the employee during the restricted period), forfeiture-for-competition clauses (clawing back deferred compensation).

## 9. AI in Employment Decisions

### 9.1 EEOC Guidance
The EEOC has issued guidance on AI and automated systems in employment decisions (May 2023). Key points: employers are liable for discriminatory outcomes of AI tools even if developed by third parties; algorithmic decision-making can produce disparate impact; employers should validate AI tools for adverse impact; reasonable accommodation obligations extend to AI-administered assessments.

### 9.2 NYC Local Law 144
Requires annual bias audits of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) used in hiring and promotion in New York City. Notice requirements to candidates. Effective July 2023.

### 9.3 Illinois AI Video Interview Act
Requires consent before using AI to analyze video interviews. Employer must explain how AI works and what characteristics it evaluates. Limits on sharing and retention.

## 10. Remote Work Legal Considerations

- **State tax nexus**: employee working remotely in a different state may create tax nexus (income tax withholding, business registration obligations).
- **Workers' compensation**: generally governed by the state where work is performed. Remote workers may file claims in their home state.
- **Wage and hour**: state where work is performed governs minimum wage, overtime, and meal/rest break requirements.
- **Workplace safety**: OSHA obligations extend to home offices in limited circumstances (employer is not expected to inspect home offices, but must ensure work-from-home employees are not exposed to recognized hazards).
- **Privacy**: state privacy laws vary for employee monitoring; some require notice or consent before monitoring (Connecticut, Delaware, New York).
- **Expense reimbursement**: several states (California, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, New Hampshire) require reimbursement of necessary business expenses including home internet and phone for remote workers.

## 11. Agent Application Guidelines

### For Jenny (CLO)
1. **Review all employment agreements** for at-will language, proper classification, and compliance with applicable state law (especially California, New York, and the employer's home state).
2. **Audit worker classifications** using the ABC test as the most restrictive standard to ensure conservative compliance.
3. **Flag any non-compete** as high-risk given the evolving legal landscape; recommend non-solicitation and NDA alternatives.
4. **Ensure AI hiring tools** (if used) have documented bias audits and comply with NYC LL144 and EEOC guidance.

### For Larry (Auditor)
1. **Verify FLSA compliance**: confirm exempt classifications meet all three tests (salary basis, salary level, duties).
2. **Monitor state law changes**: employment law is highly state-specific and rapidly evolving.
3. **Audit trail**: all employment-related decisions (hiring, termination, compensation changes) must be logged with the reasoning documented.
4. **Escalation**: any termination, discrimination claim, or wage dispute must generate a decision_memo with risk tier >= 2.
