## 1. What Is a Security?

### 1.1 The Howey Test (SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 1946)
An "investment contract" (and therefore a security) exists when there is: (1) an **investment of money** (broadly construed to include any form of consideration), (2) in a **common enterprise** (horizontal commonality — pooling of investor funds; some circuits accept vertical commonality), (3) with a **reasonable expectation of profits** (capital appreciation or participation in earnings), (4) derived from the **efforts of others** (managerial efforts of a promoter or third party are essential to the success of the enterprise). This test applies broadly and captures many novel financial instruments including, potentially, crypto tokens and revenue-sharing agreements.

### 1.2 Reves Test (Reves v. Ernst & Young, 1990)
The "family resemblance" test for notes. A note is presumed a security unless it bears a resemblance to instruments on a judicially crafted list of exceptions (notes delivered in consumer financing, home mortgages, short-term notes secured by liens, character loans, accounts receivable, notes formalizing open-account debts in ordinary course). Four factors: (1) motivation of the parties, (2) plan of distribution, (3) reasonable expectations of the investing public, (4) existence of an alternative regulatory regime.

## 2. Securities Act of 1933

The '33 Act governs the **offering and sale** of securities. Its core principle: full and fair disclosure to investors through registration or qualifying exemptions.

### 2.1 Registration (Section 5)
Securities must be registered with the SEC before public offering unless an exemption applies. Registration statement (Form S-1 for IPOs) must include: description of the business, financial statements (audited), risk factors, management background, use of proceeds. The SEC reviews for completeness and clarity (not merit). Effective registration permits public sales. Gun-jumping rules restrict communications before and during registration (quiet period, waiting period, post-effective period).

### 2.2 Regulation D Exemptions (Rules 504, 506(b), 506(c))
The most commonly used exemptions for private placements.

- **Rule 506(b)**: unlimited offering amount. Unlimited accredited investors. Up to 35 non-accredited but sophisticated investors (must receive disclosure document). **No general solicitation or advertising**. Self-executing exemption (no SEC filing required, though Form D must be filed within 15 days). Federal preemption of state registration (blue sky laws).
- **Rule 506(c)**: unlimited offering amount. **General solicitation and advertising permitted**. But ALL purchasers must be accredited investors, and the issuer must take **reasonable steps to verify** accredited investor status (reviewing tax returns, bank statements, third-party verification letters, or using SEC-approved verification methods). Form D filing required.
- **Rule 504**: offering amount limited to $10 million in a 12-month period. No general solicitation (unless state-registered). No accredited investor limitation. State securities law compliance required (not preempted).

### 2.3 Regulation A+ (Rules 251-263)
Mini-IPO framework. **Tier 1**: offerings up to $20 million in 12 months. State registration required. No ongoing reporting. **Tier 2**: offerings up to $75 million in 12 months. State registration preempted. Ongoing semi-annual and annual reporting (on Forms 1-SA and 1-K). Investment limits for non-accredited investors (10% of greater of annual income or net worth). Offering circular required (Form 1-A), reviewed by SEC.

### 2.4 Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF, Section 4(a)(6))
Offerings up to $5 million in a 12-month period. Must use an SEC-registered intermediary (funding portal or broker-dealer). Investment limits based on annual income and net worth. Disclosure requirements (Form C). Ongoing annual reporting (Form C-AR). Securities subject to one-year resale restrictions. Available to US companies that are not reporting companies, investment companies, or blank check companies.

## 3. Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The '34 Act governs the **trading of securities** after issuance. Establishes the SEC. Regulates exchanges, broker-dealers, and public company reporting.

### 3.1 Reporting Requirements
Public companies must file: Form 10-K (annual report), Form 10-Q (quarterly report), Form 8-K (current report for material events), proxy statements (Schedule 14A). Beneficial ownership reports: Schedule 13D (>5% ownership with activist intent), Schedule 13G (>5% passive ownership), Forms 3, 4, 5 (insider transactions). Sarbanes-Oxley Section 302 (CEO/CFO certification of financial statements).

### 3.2 Insider Trading (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5)
Rule 10b-5 prohibits fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. Insider trading theory: trading on material, non-public information (MNPI) in breach of a duty. **Classical theory**: corporate insiders (officers, directors, employees) who trade on MNPI. **Misappropriation theory** (United States v. O'Hagan, 1997): outsiders who trade on MNPI obtained through a relationship of trust and confidence. **Tipper-tippee liability** (Dirks v. SEC, 1983): tipper must receive a personal benefit; tippee must know or should know of the breach. **Materiality**: information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision (TSC Industries v. Northway, 1976). Rule 10b5-1 plans provide an affirmative defense for pre-planned trades.

### 3.3 Anti-Fraud Provisions
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5: unlawful to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; make any untrue statement of material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make statements not misleading; or engage in any act, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit. Private right of action requires: (1) material misrepresentation or omission, (2) scienter (intent to deceive), (3) connection with purchase or sale, (4) reliance, (5) economic loss, (6) loss causation.

## 4. Accredited Investor Definition (Rule 501)

An individual is an accredited investor if: (a) net worth exceeding $1 million (excluding primary residence), individually or jointly with spouse/spousal equivalent; (b) income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly) in each of the two most recent years with reasonable expectation of the same in the current year; (c) holds Series 7, 65, or 82 license in good standing; or (d) is a "knowledgeable employee" of a private fund. Entity accreditation: bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business development company; or entity with assets exceeding $5 million; or entity in which all equity owners are accredited investors. Family offices with at least $5 million in AUM qualify. LLCs with $5 million in assets qualify.

## 5. JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, 2012)

Key provisions: (a) created Reg CF, (b) amended Reg A into Reg A+, (c) created Rule 506(c) (general solicitation), (d) created "emerging growth company" (EGC) status with reduced reporting requirements for companies with <$1.235 billion in annual gross revenues for up to 5 years, (e) raised the shareholder threshold for mandatory '34 Act registration from 500 to 2,000 (with 500 of those being non-accredited investors).

---

## 6. Blue Sky Laws

State securities laws governing the offering and sale of securities. Named from early 20th-century judicial references to "speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of blue sky." Most states follow the Uniform Securities Act. Registration requirements vary: notice filing (for federally covered securities), coordination (timed with federal registration), or qualification (independent state review). Rule 506 offerings are federally preempted from state registration but still subject to state anti-fraud provisions and notice filing requirements (typically Form D plus filing fee).

---

## 7. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX, 2002)

Enacted after Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco scandals. Key provisions: Section 302 (CEO/CFO certification of financial reports), Section 404 (internal controls over financial reporting — management assessment and auditor attestation), Section 802 (criminal penalties for destroying, altering, or concealing records — 20 years imprisonment), Section 806 (whistleblower protections), Section 906 (criminal certification of financial reports). Applies to public companies (SEC reporting companies). SOX-like principles are best practices for private companies, especially pre-IPO.

## 8. Token and Crypto Securities Analysis

### 8.1 SEC Framework for Digital Assets
The SEC applies the Howey test to digital assets. Many tokens are securities when sold to fund development of a network/platform. The "sufficient decentralization" concept (Hinman speech, 2018) suggests a token may not be a security if the network is sufficiently decentralized that purchasers no longer reasonably expect profits from the efforts of a single promoter or group. This analysis is fact-specific and evolving.

### 8.2 Key Enforcement Actions
SEC v. Ripple Labs (2023) — court found that XRP sales on exchanges (programmatic sales) did not constitute securities transactions, but institutional sales did. SEC v. Telegram (2020) — GRAM tokens were unregistered securities. SEC v. LBRY (2022) — LBC tokens were securities when sold to raise money for development.

### 8.3 Regulation S (Offshore Offerings)
Safe harbor for offers and sales of securities outside the United States. Requirements: transaction must occur in an "offshore transaction," no "directed selling efforts" in the US. Category 1 (no US market interest): minimal restrictions. Category 2 (reporting issuers): 40-day distribution compliance period. Category 3 (non-reporting issuers): one-year distribution compliance period. Flowback prevention measures required for Categories 2 and 3.

## 9. Agent Compliance Protocol

### Communication Restrictions
1. **No investment solicitation**: agents must NEVER solicit investments, offer securities, or make representations that could be construed as an offer of securities. Any discussion of equity, tokens, or fundraising must be preceded by: "This is not an offer to sell or solicitation to buy securities."
2. **No forward-looking statements without safe harbor**: any projection or forecast must be accompanied by meaningful cautionary language identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ (Private Securities Litigation Reform Act safe harbor).
3. **No material non-public information**: agents must never communicate MNPI to anyone who might trade on it. Establish information barriers.
4. **No unregistered offers**: before any equity, convertible note, SAFE, token, or revenue-sharing arrangement, Jenny must confirm a registration exemption applies and document the analysis.

### Tina (CFO) Specific
1. Ensure all financial statements and projections are accurate, complete, and not misleading.
2. Track accredited investor verifications for any Rule 506(c) offering.
3. Monitor filing deadlines (Form D: 15 days after first sale; Reg A+ ongoing reports).
4. Any fundraising activity must generate a decision_memo with risk tier >= 3.

### Jenny (CLO) Specific
1. Conduct Howey test analysis before any novel financial arrangement.
2. Prepare and review all offering documents, subscription agreements, and investor questionnaires.
3. Ensure compliance with applicable state blue sky requirements.
4. Monitor securities law developments, particularly regarding digital assets and AI tokens.
