# Dispute Resolution & Litigation

## Purpose
This document provides Atlas UX agents — particularly Jenny (CLO), Atlas (CEO), and Larry (Auditor) — with a comprehensive understanding of dispute resolution mechanisms, litigation processes, and strategic considerations for evaluating and managing legal disputes. The goal is for agents to identify legal risks early, assess resolution options, and escalate appropriately.

## 1. Pre-Litigation Strategies

### 1.1 Demand Letters
A formal written communication asserting a legal claim and requesting specific relief. Elements of an effective demand letter: (a) clear statement of the factual basis, (b) identification of the legal theories supporting the claim, (c) specific relief demanded (payment amount, corrective action, cessation of conduct), (d) deadline for response (typically 10-30 days), (e) statement of consequences if demand is not met (litigation, regulatory complaint). Demand letters serve multiple purposes: providing required pre-suit notice (some statutes require a demand before filing suit), creating a record for later use, encouraging settlement, and demonstrating good faith. The letter itself may be admissible as evidence, so draft carefully. Avoid inflammatory language or threats beyond legitimate legal action.

### 1.2 Cease and Desist Letters
Sent to notify a party of alleged infringement (IP), contract breach, defamation, or other wrongful conduct and demand cessation. Not legally binding but creates constructive notice (particularly relevant for willful infringement analysis, which can affect damages). If ignored, the sender may pursue injunctive relief. Receipt of a cease and desist triggers a duty to investigate in good faith and potentially preserve relevant evidence.

### 1.3 Settlement Negotiations
Settlement resolves disputes without litigation. Key principles: (a) Rule 408 (Federal Rules of Evidence): offers, acceptances, and statements made during compromise negotiations are generally inadmissible to prove liability or amount; (b) settlement agreements are binding contracts and should be in writing; (c) include release and waiver provisions, confidentiality, non-disparagement, and (where applicable) consent or denial of liability; (d) consider tax implications (compensatory damages for physical injury are excludable under IRC Section 104; punitive damages and emotional distress damages are generally taxable).

## 2. Litigation Process

### 2.1 Filing the Complaint
The plaintiff files a complaint with the court, stating: the parties, jurisdictional basis, factual allegations, legal claims (causes of action), and prayer for relief. Federal courts: notice pleading (sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face — Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 2009). Summons is issued and served on the defendant along with the complaint. Service must comply with Rule 4 (personal service, substitute service, service by agent, waiver of service).

### 2.2 Answer and Responsive Pleadings
The defendant must respond within 21 days of service (60 days if waiver of service was requested). Options: (a) **answer** — admitting, denying, or stating insufficient knowledge as to each allegation, plus affirmative defenses; (b) **motion to dismiss** — challenging the complaint's legal sufficiency (Rule 12(b)(6): failure to state a claim), jurisdiction (12(b)(1)-(2)), or service (12(b)(4)-(5)). A motion to dismiss extends the time to answer. **Counterclaims**: compulsory (arising from same transaction — must be asserted or waived) and permissive (unrelated to the transaction).

### 2.3 Discovery
The process of obtaining evidence from the opposing party and third parties. Scope: any non-privileged matter relevant to a party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case (Rule 26(b)(1)). Discovery tools:
- **Interrogatories** (Rule 33): written questions requiring written answers under oath. Limited to 25 per party (federal).
- **Requests for production** (Rule 34): compelling production of documents, electronically stored information (ESI), and tangible items.
- **Requests for admission** (Rule 36): requesting the opposing party admit or deny specific facts. Unanswered requests are deemed admitted.
- **Depositions** (Rule 30): oral examination of witnesses under oath, recorded by a court reporter. Each side limited to 10 depositions of 7 hours each (federal). Can depose parties and non-parties (subpoena required for non-parties).
- **Subpoenas** (Rule 45): compelling testimony or document production from non-parties.

**Privilege**: attorney-client privilege (communications between attorney and client for the purpose of legal advice) and work product doctrine (materials prepared in anticipation of litigation) protect certain information from discovery. Privilege can be waived by voluntary disclosure.

### 2.4 Summary Judgment (Rule 56)
A motion requesting judgment as a matter of law when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact." The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying the absence of a genuine issue. The non-moving party must then present evidence creating a genuine dispute. Courts view evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Summary judgment resolves cases — or narrows issues — before trial.

### 2.5 Trial
If the case survives dispositive motions, it proceeds to trial. **Jury trial** right: Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial for legal claims exceeding $20; equitable claims are tried to the court. Trial stages: jury selection (voir dire), opening statements, plaintiff's case-in-chief, defense case, rebuttal, closing arguments, jury instructions, deliberation, verdict. Burden of proof: preponderance of the evidence (civil); clear and convincing evidence (certain claims like fraud); beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal).

### 2.6 Post-Trial Motions and Appeal
Post-trial motions: renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (Rule 50(b)), motion for new trial (Rule 59), motion to alter or amend judgment (Rule 59(e)). **Appeal**: filed with the appropriate appellate court (circuit court of appeals for federal; intermediate appellate court for state). Notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of judgment (federal). Appellate courts review: legal questions de novo, factual findings for clear error (bench trial) or sufficiency of the evidence (jury trial), discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion.

## 3. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

### 3.1 Negotiation
Direct discussion between the parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. No third-party involvement. Interest-based negotiation (Fisher and Ury, "Getting to Yes") focuses on underlying interests rather than positions. Most disputes are resolved through negotiation.

### 3.2 Mediation
A neutral third-party mediator facilitates negotiation between the parties. The mediator has no authority to impose a resolution. Advantages: party control, confidentiality, preservation of relationships, cost efficiency, speed. Mediation settlement agreements are enforceable as contracts. Many courts require mediation before trial. Success rates: approximately 70-80% of mediated cases reach settlement.

### 3.3 Arbitration
A neutral arbitrator (or panel) hears evidence and renders a binding decision (award). **Binding arbitration**: the award is final and subject to very limited judicial review (Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16; grounds for vacatur under Section 10: corruption, fraud, arbitrator misconduct, exceeded powers). **Non-binding arbitration**: advisory; parties may reject the award and proceed to litigation.

**Key considerations**: (a) limited discovery (typically no depositions unless agreed), (b) no jury, (c) limited appeal rights, (d) arbitrator selection (AAA, JAMS, or agreed-upon arbitrator), (e) can be faster and less expensive than litigation, but arbitrator fees can be significant, (f) class action waiver in arbitration clauses is generally enforceable (Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 2018).

### 3.4 Mandatory Arbitration Clauses
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) establishes a strong federal policy favoring arbitration. Pre-dispute arbitration agreements are generally enforceable, including in consumer and employment contexts (AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, 2011; Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 2018). Exceptions: the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (2022) invalidates pre-dispute arbitration agreements for sexual assault/harassment claims. Some state laws restrict mandatory arbitration in specific contexts.

## 4. Class Actions

### 4.1 Federal Rule 23 Requirements
**Prerequisites** (Rule 23(a)): (1) numerosity (class so numerous that joinder is impracticable), (2) commonality (common questions of law or fact — Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, 2011 — must generate "common answers"), (3) typicality (claims of class representatives are typical of the class), (4) adequacy (class representatives will fairly and adequately protect class interests).

**Types** (Rule 23(b)): (b)(1) — risk of inconsistent adjudications; (b)(2) — injunctive/declaratory relief (civil rights cases); **(b)(3)** — damages class action — requires predominance (common questions predominate over individual ones) and superiority (class action is superior to other methods). Class certification is the critical gateway — most cases settle after certification.

### 4.2 Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA, 28 U.S.C. Section 1332(d))
Provides federal jurisdiction for class actions with: minimal diversity (any class member diverse from any defendant), 100+ class members, and amount in controversy exceeding $5 million in aggregate. Allows defendants to remove state-court class actions to federal court.

## 5. Jurisdiction

### 5.1 Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Federal courts have limited jurisdiction: **federal question** (28 U.S.C. Section 1331 — cases arising under federal law) and **diversity** (28 U.S.C. Section 1332 — parties are citizens of different states AND amount in controversy exceeds $75,000). Supplemental jurisdiction (Section 1367) allows federal courts to hear related state-law claims.

### 5.2 Personal Jurisdiction
A court must have authority over the defendant. **General jurisdiction**: defendant is "at home" in the forum (domicile for individuals; state of incorporation or principal place of business for corporations — Daimler AG v. Bauman, 2014). **Specific jurisdiction**: defendant has minimum contacts with the forum arising from or related to the claim (International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 1945). Due process requires that exercising jurisdiction comport with "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." Internet-based jurisdiction: operating a website alone is typically insufficient; interactive sites targeting forum residents may establish jurisdiction (Zippo Manufacturing v. Zippo Dot Com, 1997 — sliding scale test).

### 5.3 Venue
Determines which court within a jurisdiction is the proper forum. Federal: proper venue where (a) any defendant resides (if all defendants reside in the same state), (b) a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, or (c) any defendant may be found (if no other proper venue — Section 1391(b)). Forum selection clauses are generally enforceable (M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 1972) unless unreasonable or unjust.

## 6. Statute of Limitations

Time limits for filing legal claims. Once the statute expires, the claim is barred. Common periods:
- **Breach of contract**: 4-6 years (varies by state; UCC: 4 years for sale of goods)
- **Tort claims (negligence, personal injury)**: 2-3 years
- **Defamation**: 1-3 years
- **Fraud**: 3-6 years (often with a discovery rule)
- **Federal civil rights (Title VII)**: charge filed with EEOC within 180/300 days; lawsuit within 90 days of right-to-sue letter
- **Patent infringement**: 6 years (damages limitation only; no statute for filing)
- **Copyright infringement**: 3 years from accrual
- **Trademark infringement**: laches defense (no statutory limit but delay may bar relief)
- **Securities fraud (Section 10(b))**: 2 years from discovery, 5 years from the violation
- **FLSA claims**: 2 years (3 years for willful violations)

**Tolling doctrines**: discovery rule (statute begins when plaintiff knew or should have known), fraudulent concealment, equitable tolling, minority, mental incapacity.

## 7. Evidence Preservation (Litigation Holds)

When litigation is reasonably anticipated, parties have a duty to preserve relevant evidence. This duty attaches before a lawsuit is filed. Failure to preserve can result in: adverse inference instructions, monetary sanctions, case-dispositive sanctions, or criminal obstruction charges. **Litigation hold process**: (1) identify the trigger event, (2) identify custodians and data sources, (3) issue a written preservation notice, (4) suspend routine destruction policies for relevant materials, (5) collect and preserve relevant ESI and physical documents, (6) monitor compliance. **Proportionality**: preservation efforts must be reasonable and proportional to the needs of the case (Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)).

## 8. Insurance and Indemnification

### 8.1 Commercial General Liability (CGL)
Covers bodily injury, property damage, personal injury (defamation, false imprisonment), and advertising injury claims. Occurrence-based vs. claims-made policies. Duty to defend (broader than duty to indemnify; insurer must defend if any allegation in the complaint potentially falls within coverage).

### 8.2 Errors and Omissions (E&O) / Professional Liability
Covers claims arising from professional services — negligent acts, errors, or omissions. Essential for technology companies and SaaS providers. Typically claims-made (must be reported during the policy period or extended reporting period).

### 8.3 Cyber Liability Insurance
Covers data breaches, cyber attacks, business interruption from cyber events, regulatory defense costs, notification costs, credit monitoring, and data recovery. First-party coverage (direct losses) and third-party coverage (claims by affected parties). Increasingly important for SaaS platforms.

### 8.4 Contractual Indemnification
Allocation of risk between contracting parties. Indemnitor agrees to hold harmless and defend the indemnitee against specified claims. Key issues: scope of indemnification, limitation to third-party claims vs. direct claims, caps on liability, carve-outs for willful misconduct or gross negligence, insurance requirements. Anti-indemnity statutes in some states prohibit certain types of indemnification (particularly in construction).

## 9. Cost-Benefit Analysis of Litigation

Jenny should evaluate disputes using this framework:
1. **Merits assessment**: probability of prevailing on each claim/defense (assign percentage).
2. **Damages calculation**: best case, worst case, and most likely outcomes.
3. **Litigation costs**: attorney's fees, expert witness fees, discovery costs, court costs, internal time and disruption. Federal litigation average: $200,000-$500,000+ through trial; complex commercial cases: $1-5 million+.
4. **Time horizon**: typical federal case: 18-36 months to trial; appellate review adds 12-24 months.
5. **Collectability**: defendant's ability to pay a judgment.
6. **Precedent risk**: will the outcome create adverse precedent for future disputes?
7. **Reputational impact**: public litigation can affect business relationships and public perception.
8. **Alternative resolution**: probability and cost of settlement vs. trial outcome.

**Expected value formula**: (probability of success x likely recovery) - (litigation costs) = expected value. If expected value is positive and exceeds the best available settlement, litigation may be justified.

## 10. Agent Dispute Resolution Protocol

### For Jenny (CLO)
1. **Intake**: when a dispute arises, document: parties involved, factual background, legal theories, damages estimate, key documents, statute of limitations deadline.
2. **Triage**: classify by severity (minor/routine, significant, existential). Assign risk tier for decision_memo purposes.
3. **Pre-litigation**: always attempt resolution through demand letter and negotiation before recommending litigation. Calculate cost-benefit analysis.
4. **Preservation**: issue a litigation hold immediately when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Coordinate with IT/data teams to preserve relevant ESI.
5. **ADR evaluation**: assess whether arbitration or mediation is required by contract or advisable given the circumstances.
6. **Escalation**: any lawsuit filed against DEAD APP CORP, any claim exceeding $10,000, or any claim involving IP, securities, or employment must generate a decision_memo with risk tier >= 3 for human review.

### For Larry (Auditor)
1. Maintain an inventory of all pending or threatened disputes with status updates.
2. Ensure litigation hold compliance across all relevant systems.
3. Track litigation costs against budget projections.
4. Verify that insurance carriers are notified of covered claims within policy notice periods.
