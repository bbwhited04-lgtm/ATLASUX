# Antitrust & Competition Law

## Purpose
This document provides Atlas UX agents — particularly Jenny (CLO), Binky (CRO), and Atlas (CEO) — with comprehensive antitrust and competition law knowledge. Agents involved in pricing, market communications, partnership negotiations, and competitive strategy must understand these constraints. Antitrust violations carry criminal penalties (up to $100 million for corporations, $1 million and 10 years imprisonment for individuals under the Sherman Act) and treble damages in private actions.

## 1. Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. Sections 1-7)

### 1.1 Section 1: Agreements in Restraint of Trade
Prohibits "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce." Requires: (1) an agreement (contract, combination, or conspiracy — unilateral conduct is not covered by Section 1), (2) that unreasonably restrains trade, (3) affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The agreement can be express or inferred from circumstantial evidence (conscious parallelism alone is insufficient without "plus factors" indicating agreement — Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 2007).

#### Per Se Violations
Certain categories of agreements are so inherently anticompetitive that they are illegal without inquiry into their actual competitive effects or business justifications:
- **Horizontal price fixing**: competitors agreeing on prices, price ranges, or pricing formulas (United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 1940).
- **Market allocation**: competitors dividing markets by territory, customers, or products.
- **Bid rigging**: competitors coordinating bids on contracts.
- **Group boycotts** (concerted refusals to deal): competitors jointly refusing to deal with a particular buyer, supplier, or competitor (some group boycotts are analyzed under rule of reason).
- **Tying arrangements** (in some circumstances): conditioning sale of one product on purchase of another when the seller has market power in the tying product.

#### Rule of Reason Analysis
All other restraints are evaluated under the rule of reason (Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 1911): (1) plaintiff demonstrates the restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect in a relevant market, (2) defendant offers procompetitive justifications, (3) plaintiff shows less restrictive alternatives could achieve the same procompetitive benefits. Burden-shifting framework.

**Quick look** analysis: an intermediate standard for restraints that are not per se illegal but appear so plainly anticompetitive that the full rule of reason is unnecessary. Defendant must provide a procompetitive justification (California Dental Association v. FTC, 1999).

### 1.2 Section 2: Monopolization
Three offenses: (a) **monopolization** — possession of monopoly power in a relevant market AND the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power through exclusionary or anticompetitive conduct (as distinguished from growth or development due to superior product, business acumen, or historical accident — United States v. Grinnell Corp., 1966); (b) **attempted monopolization** — specific intent to monopolize, anticompetitive conduct, and dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power; (c) **conspiracy to monopolize**.

**Monopoly power**: the ability to control prices or exclude competition. Typically requires a market share of 70%+ (though context-dependent). Market share alone is insufficient; barriers to entry, market dynamics, and the competitive landscape matter.

**Relevant market definition**: product market (all products reasonably interchangeable by consumers — Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 1962; hypothetical monopolist test / SSNIP test) and geographic market (area of effective competition). Market definition is often the decisive battleground in antitrust cases.

## 2. Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sections 12-27)

### 2.1 Section 3: Tying and Exclusive Dealing
Prohibits sales conditioned on the buyer not dealing with the seller's competitors when the effect may be to substantially lessen competition. **Tying**: seller conditions sale of one product (tying product) on purchase of another (tied product). Illegal when: seller has market power in the tying product, the arrangement affects a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product, and there is coercion. **Exclusive dealing**: buyer agrees to purchase exclusively from one seller. Analyzed under rule of reason; key factors include market share foreclosed, duration of agreement, and extent of market coverage (Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 1961).

### 2.2 Section 7: Mergers and Acquisitions
Prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect "may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly." Covers: stock acquisitions, asset acquisitions, joint ventures. Analysis: market definition, market concentration (HHI — Herfindahl-Hirschman Index), competitive effects (unilateral and coordinated), entry conditions, efficiencies, failing firm defense. DOJ/FTC Merger Guidelines (most recently updated in 2023) provide the analytical framework. Structural presumption: a merger is presumptively anticompetitive if it significantly increases concentration in a highly concentrated market.

### 2.3 Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act
Pre-merger notification requirement for transactions exceeding size-of-transaction and size-of-person thresholds (adjusted annually for inflation; 2024 thresholds: $111.4 million size-of-transaction minimum). Parties must file and observe a waiting period (30 days; 15 days for cash tender offers) before consummating the transaction. DOJ or FTC may issue a "second request" for additional information, extending the waiting period. Failure to file: penalties up to ~$50,000 per day.

## 3. Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. Section 45)

### Section 5: Unfair Methods of Competition
Broader than the Sherman Act. Reaches conduct that: violates the Sherman or Clayton Act, or constitutes an "unfair method of competition" even if not a Sherman/Clayton violation. The FTC is the sole enforcer of Section 5 (no private right of action). The FTC can also challenge "unfair or deceptive acts or practices" (UDAP) in or affecting commerce. FTC enforcement actions can result in cease-and-desist orders, civil penalties for violations of orders (up to $50,120 per violation), and disgorgement.

## 4. Specific Anticompetitive Practices

### 4.1 Price Fixing
Any agreement between competitors to raise, fix, stabilize, or adhere to a particular price or pricing formula is per se illegal. This includes: setting minimum or maximum prices, agreeing to eliminate discounts, establishing uniform credit terms, agreeing to price increases, exchanging pricing information with the purpose of stabilizing prices. Even unsuccessful or abandoned price-fixing conspiracies are illegal. The agreement itself, not the effect, constitutes the violation.

### 4.2 Market Allocation
Agreements between competitors to divide territories, customers, or product lines. Per se illegal regardless of the reasonableness of the allocation. Includes agreements not to compete for certain customers or in certain geographic areas.

### 4.3 Bid Rigging
Forms include: complementary bidding (submitting intentionally high or non-competitive bids), bid rotation (competitors take turns being the lowest bidder), bid suppression (competitors agree not to bid), and subcontracting or joint venture arrangements that limit competition. Per se illegal. Criminal prosecutions are common.

### 4.4 Information Exchange
Competitors sharing competitively sensitive information (prices, costs, output, capacity, business plans, customer lists) may violate Section 1 if the exchange facilitates coordination. Risk factors: concentrated market, homogeneous products, recent/specific information, identification of individual firms. Safe practices: sharing through a neutral third party, aggregated data only, historical data, public information. Trade association activities require careful antitrust protocols.

### 4.5 Predatory Pricing
Pricing below cost to drive competitors out of the market, then raising prices. Requires: (1) pricing below an appropriate measure of cost (average variable cost or average total cost), and (2) a dangerous probability of recouping the losses through later supracompetitive pricing (Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson, 1993). Rarely successful as a legal claim.

### 4.6 Refusals to Deal
Generally, a firm has no duty to deal with any particular party. But: monopolist's refusal to deal with a competitor may violate Section 2 if it harms competition (Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing, 1985 — termination of a profitable, voluntary course of dealing with anticompetitive intent). Essential facilities doctrine (debated and narrowly applied): monopolist controlling an essential facility may be required to provide access on reasonable terms.

## 5. Platform Competition Issues

### 5.1 Digital Platform Monopolization
Major enforcement actions against tech platforms (DOJ v. Google, 2024 — search monopoly; FTC v. Meta, 2020 — social media monopoly through acquisitions). Key issues: self-preferencing, data advantages as barriers to entry, network effects, killer acquisitions (acquiring nascent competitors).

### 5.2 App Store and Platform Rules
Platform operators imposing terms on third-party developers (Apple v. Epic Games, 2021 — Apple's App Store policies largely upheld but required allowing external payment links under California UCL). Anti-steering provisions, most-favored-nation clauses, and mandatory use of platform payment systems are under scrutiny.

### 5.3 AI and Algorithmic Collusion
Concern that AI pricing algorithms could facilitate tacit collusion without explicit agreement. If algorithms are designed or configured to coordinate pricing with competitors, this may constitute a price-fixing agreement. The "hub and spoke" theory may apply when competitors use the same AI pricing platform. FTC and DOJ are actively monitoring algorithmic pricing in industries including rental housing and airline pricing.

## 6. International Competition Law

### 6.1 EU Competition Law
Article 101 TFEU (equivalent to Sherman Section 1): prohibits agreements restricting competition. Block exemptions for certain categories (vertical agreements, R&D, specialization). Article 102 TFEU (equivalent to Sherman Section 2): prohibits abuse of dominant position (predatory pricing, tying, refusal to deal, excessive pricing — which is actionable in the EU but generally not in the US). EU Merger Regulation: mandatory notification for transactions exceeding turnover thresholds. European Commission is the primary enforcer.

### 6.2 UK Competition Act 1998
Chapter I prohibition (anti-competitive agreements) and Chapter II prohibition (abuse of dominant position), modeled on EU Articles 101 and 102. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) enforces. Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 gives CMA additional powers over digital markets.

## 7. Agent Compliance Protocol

### For All Agents
1. **Never communicate with competitors** about pricing, costs, output, capacity, market strategy, customer allocation, or bidding strategies. If a competitor raises these topics, terminate the conversation and document it.
2. **Never agree with competitors** to fix prices, allocate markets or customers, rig bids, or boycott suppliers or customers.
3. **Document pricing decisions**: all pricing must be based on independent business judgment. Document the competitive analysis, cost basis, and business rationale.
4. **Trade association caution**: if agents interact with industry groups, follow antitrust protocols (prepared agendas, antitrust compliance statement at meetings, leave if improper topics arise).

### For Binky (CRO) and Sales Agents
1. **Independent pricing**: set prices based on costs, market conditions, and competitive dynamics — never based on agreements with competitors.
2. **No predatory pricing**: do not price below variable cost with intent to eliminate competition.
3. **Resale price maintenance**: vertical agreements on minimum resale prices are analyzed under rule of reason (Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, 2007). Maximum resale prices are generally lawful. Suggested retail prices are lawful; mandated retail prices require analysis.
4. **Exclusive dealing**: exclusive arrangements with customers or distributors require rule-of-reason analysis; avoid foreclosing a substantial share of the market.

### For Jenny (CLO)
1. **Merger/acquisition review**: conduct preliminary antitrust analysis for any acquisition target. Consider market shares, HHI impact, and competitive effects.
2. **Contract review**: flag any contract provision that could constitute tying, exclusive dealing, or most-favored-nation clause with anticompetitive potential.
3. **Escalation**: any communication from a competitor raising potentially anticompetitive topics, any government antitrust inquiry, or any agreement that could be perceived as anticompetitive must generate a decision_memo with risk tier >= 3.
