## 1. Business Entity Types

### 1.1 Sole Proprietorship
The simplest form. No legal distinction between the owner and the business. No formation filing required (business licenses may be needed). The owner has unlimited personal liability for all business debts and obligations. Income reported on Schedule C of the owner's personal tax return. Cannot have investors in the traditional sense. Terminates upon the owner's death or decision to cease operations.

### 1.2 General Partnership
Formed when two or more persons carry on a business for profit (Uniform Partnership Act, UPA). No filing required, though a written partnership agreement is strongly recommended. All partners have joint and several liability for partnership obligations. Each partner is an agent of the partnership with authority to bind it. Default rules: equal management rights, equal profit sharing. Fiduciary duties of loyalty and care apply between partners.

### 1.3 Limited Partnership (LP)
Requires filing a certificate of limited partnership with the state. Has at least one general partner (unlimited liability, management authority) and one or more limited partners (liability limited to their capital contributions, no management rights). Limited partners who participate in management may lose limited liability protection (though modern RULPA/ULPA 2001 have relaxed this). Common in investment funds and real estate.

### 1.4 Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
A general partnership that elects LLP status by filing with the state. Partners are not personally liable for the negligence or misconduct of other partners (the "liability shield" varies by state — full shield vs. partial shield). Commonly used by professional firms (law, accounting). All partners typically still participate in management.

### 1.5 Limited Liability Company (LLC)
A hybrid entity combining partnership flexibility with corporate liability protection. Formed by filing articles of organization with the state. Governed by an operating agreement (the foundational governance document). Members have limited liability — personal assets are shielded from business debts. Tax flexibility: default single-member (disregarded entity) or multi-member (partnership); can elect C-Corp or S-Corp taxation. Management: member-managed (all members participate) or manager-managed (designated managers). No requirement for annual meetings, minutes, or formal resolutions in most states (though recommended for liability protection).

### 1.6 C-Corporation
The default corporate form. Formed by filing articles of incorporation with the state. Separate legal entity with perpetual existence. Shareholders have limited liability. Double taxation: corporation pays corporate income tax on profits, shareholders pay personal income tax on dividends. Governed by articles of incorporation and bylaws. Board of directors manages the corporation; officers handle day-to-day operations. Required formalities: annual shareholder meetings, board meetings, corporate minutes, annual reports. Can have unlimited shareholders of various classes. Preferred for venture capital funding and IPO.

### 1.7 S-Corporation
A C-Corporation that elects S-Corp status under IRC Section 1361. Pass-through taxation: income, losses, deductions, and credits flow to shareholders' personal returns. Restrictions: maximum 100 shareholders, one class of stock (though voting and non-voting shares permitted), shareholders must be US citizens/residents or certain trusts/estates. No corporate-level federal income tax (with exceptions for built-in gains and passive investment income). Must meet ongoing eligibility requirements or S-election is terminated.

### 1.8 Benefit Corporation (B-Corp)
A for-profit corporation that includes positive impact on society, workers, community, and environment as part of its legally defined goals. Available in approximately 37 states. Directors must balance shareholder financial interests with the general public benefit purpose. Annual benefit report required. Distinct from B Lab "Certified B Corporation" certification (a private certification).

### 1.9 Close Corporation
A corporation with a limited number of shareholders (typically 30-50 depending on state) that elects close corporation status. May operate without a board of directors (shareholders manage directly). Less formal requirements. Restrictions on share transfers (often requiring first-offer rights to existing shareholders). Available under the statutes of many states including Missouri (RSMo Section 351.750 et seq.).

## 2. Corporate Governance

### 2.1 Articles of Incorporation / Certificate of Formation
The charter document filed with the state to create the entity. Contains: corporate name, registered agent, purpose, authorized shares (number, classes, par value), incorporator(s). Amendments require board resolution and shareholder approval.

### 2.2 Bylaws / Operating Agreement
Internal governance document not filed with the state. **Bylaws** (corporations): board size, officer positions, meeting procedures, quorum requirements, voting thresholds, indemnification provisions, conflict-of-interest policy. **Operating agreements** (LLCs): member rights and obligations, capital contributions, profit/loss allocation, management structure, transfer restrictions, dissolution provisions, buyout mechanisms.

### 2.3 Board of Directors
Elected by shareholders to oversee management. Duties include: setting strategic direction, hiring/firing officers, approving major transactions, declaring dividends, amending bylaws. Board committees (audit, compensation, nominating) handle specialized oversight. Quorum (typically majority) required for board action. Directors may act by unanimous written consent without a meeting.

### 2.4 Shareholder Rights
Right to vote (one share, one vote for common stock), right to inspect books and records (proper purpose required), right to dividends when declared, right to sue derivatively on behalf of the corporation, preemptive rights (if provided in articles), appraisal rights (dissenting shareholders in mergers/acquisitions).

## 3. Fiduciary Duties

### 3.1 Duty of Care
Directors and officers must act with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in a like position under similar circumstances. This requires: informed decision-making (reviewing materials, asking questions), reasonable inquiry, and good-faith reliance on expert reports. The standard is process-oriented, not outcome-based.

### 3.2 Duty of Loyalty
Directors must act in the best interest of the corporation, not for personal benefit. Prohibits: self-dealing transactions (unless fully disclosed and approved by disinterested directors/shareholders), usurping corporate opportunities (Guth v. Loft, 1939), competing with the corporation. Interested director transactions are voidable unless: (a) fully disclosed and approved by disinterested directors or shareholders, or (b) entirely fair to the corporation (Weinberger v. UOP, 1983).

### 3.3 Business Judgment Rule
A judicial presumption that directors acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that the action was in the corporation's best interest (Aronson v. Lewis, 1984). Courts will not second-guess business decisions if: (1) the directors were disinterested and independent, (2) they acted in good faith, (3) they were adequately informed, and (4) they rationally believed the action served the corporation. The rule shifts the burden to the challenger. It does not apply to duty-of-loyalty violations, fraud, illegality, or waste.

### 3.4 Duty of Good Faith
Increasingly recognized as a component of the duty of loyalty (Stone v. Ritter, 2006). Requires that directors not act with subjective bad faith, not consciously disregard known duties, and not engage in intentional dereliction. Failure of oversight (Caremark liability — In re Caremark International, 1996): directors can be liable for failing to implement a reporting system or ignoring red flags.

## 4. Piercing the Corporate Veil

Courts may disregard the corporate entity and hold shareholders personally liable when the corporate form is abused. Factors (vary by jurisdiction): (1) undercapitalization, (2) failure to observe corporate formalities, (3) commingling of personal and corporate funds, (4) using the entity as a mere alter ego, (5) fraud or injustice to creditors. The doctrine is applied reluctantly and is most common in closely held corporations. Single-member LLCs are particularly vulnerable. Reverse veil piercing (reaching corporate assets to satisfy a member's personal debts) is recognized in some jurisdictions.

## 5. Delaware Incorporation

Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware. Advantages: (a) sophisticated Court of Chancery (equity court with experienced judges, no juries), (b) well-developed body of corporate case law providing predictability, (c) flexible DGCL (Delaware General Corporation Law), (d) favorable tax treatment (no corporate income tax for companies that do not operate in Delaware), (e) efficient Division of Corporations. Disadvantages: franchise taxes (can be significant for authorized-share-heavy companies), qualification as a foreign corporation in the state of actual operations, potential for two sets of legal requirements. Best suited for companies anticipating VC funding, M&A activity, or public offering.

## 6. Corporate Formalities (Maintaining the Liability Shield)

Essential practices to avoid veil piercing:
1. Maintain separate bank accounts; never commingle personal and business funds.
2. Hold annual meetings of shareholders and directors (or use written consent in lieu).
3. Document all major decisions in formal minutes or resolutions.
4. Properly capitalize the entity at formation and maintain adequate capital.
5. Execute contracts in the entity's name, not personally.
6. Issue stock certificates; maintain a stock ledger.
7. File annual reports and pay franchise taxes on time.
8. Use the entity's legal name (including "Inc." / "LLC" / "Corp.") in all dealings.
9. Maintain arms-length transactions with related parties.
10. Obtain separate EIN; file separate tax returns.

---

## 7. Dissolution and Winding Up

### Voluntary Dissolution
Board resolution followed by shareholder approval (typically majority vote). File articles of dissolution with the state. Wind up affairs: pay creditors, distribute remaining assets to shareholders pro rata. Continue to exist for purpose of winding up.

### Involuntary Dissolution
Initiated by: state (failure to file reports, pay taxes), creditors (insolvency), or shareholders (deadlock, oppression, mismanagement — particularly in close corporations). Judicial dissolution requires petition to the court.

## 8. Trust Structures and Corporate Ownership

A trust may own corporate stock or LLC membership interests. The trust is not a separate entity for most state law purposes but is for tax purposes. Revocable living trusts: grantor retains control; assets pass outside probate at death. Irrevocable trusts: grantor relinquishes control; assets removed from grantor's estate for estate tax purposes. Trust ownership of a close corporation provides: continuity of ownership, privacy, estate planning benefits, and potential asset protection. The trustee has fiduciary duties to the trust beneficiaries.

## 9. Application to DEAD APP CORP

DEAD APP CORP is a Missouri closed corporation owned by THE DEAD APP CORP TRUST. Key legal considerations:

1. **Missouri close corporation statute** (RSMo Section 351.750-351.790): allows operation without a board of directors if the articles so provide; shareholders may manage directly; share transfer restrictions are enforceable; dissolution protections for minority shareholders.
2. **Trust as sole shareholder**: the trustee exercises all shareholder rights. Trust instrument governs the trustee's authority. Ensure the trust instrument authorizes business operations, capital contributions, and major transactions.
3. **Corporate formalities**: even as a close corporation, maintain minutes, resolutions, and separate accounts to preserve the liability shield.
4. **Fiduciary duties**: the trustee owes fiduciary duties to trust beneficiaries; if the trustee is also a director/officer, dual fiduciary duties apply (to the corporation and to the trust beneficiaries).
5. **Agent implications**: Atlas UX agents acting on behalf of DEAD APP CORP must ensure their actions are within the corporation's charter authority. Any agent action that constitutes a major corporate transaction (significant expenditures, entering contracts, intellectual property licensing) should be traced back to proper authorization from the trustee or designated officers.
6. **Annual compliance**: Missouri annual registration, registered agent maintenance, and any required trust filings.
