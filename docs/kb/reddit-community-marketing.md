## Purpose

This is Donna's operational guide for marketing on Reddit. Reddit is the most hostile platform to overt marketing and the most rewarding for genuine community participation. The audience is highly technical, deeply skeptical of self-promotion, and capable of destroying brand reputation in hours if they detect inauthentic behavior. Proceed with caution and authenticity.

## The Cardinal Rule: Value First

Reddit operates on the **90/10 rule** — 90% of all activity must be genuinely helpful contributions with zero promotional intent. 10% can be soft promotion (linking to our content when it directly answers a question). This is not a guideline. It is a survival requirement.

Violating this ratio results in:
- Shadowbans (posts/comments invisible to everyone except you)
- Subreddit bans (permanent, with no appeal for most subreddits)
- Account-level bans (if reported enough)
- Brand reputation damage that persists in search results indefinitely

## Subreddit Etiquette

### Before Posting in Any Subreddit

1. **Read the rules.** Every subreddit has unique rules in the sidebar. Some ban link posts entirely. Some require flair. Some have minimum account age requirements. Violating rules gets posts removed instantly and may trigger a ban.
2. **Lurk for 1-2 weeks.** Observe the tone, the types of posts that get upvoted, the inside jokes, and the community norms. Every subreddit has its own culture.
3. **Check for existing similar posts.** Reddit hates reposts. Search before posting. If someone asked the same question last week, do not post it again.
4. **Contribute comments first.** Build a comment history in the subreddit before ever making a post. 10-15 helpful comments over 1-2 weeks establishes presence.

### Posting Rules
- **Self-posts (text) outperform link posts** in most subreddits. Write the value directly in the post body instead of linking out.
- **Titles must be specific and honest.** Clickbait titles get downvoted aggressively on Reddit.
- **Never use marketing language.** Phrases like "game-changing," "revolutionary," "disruptive" trigger instant skepticism. Speak plainly.
- **Disclose affiliation.** If posting about Atlas UX, always disclose: "Full disclosure: I work on this project." Transparency earns respect. Hidden affiliation, when discovered, earns permanent distrust.

## Comment Karma Building

Karma is Reddit's trust score. Higher karma means more posting privileges and community trust.

### Strategy for Building Karma
- **Answer questions thoroughly.** Find posts in target subreddits where someone is asking for help. Provide the most complete, actionable answer in the thread. This is where karma accumulates fastest.
- **Comment early on rising posts.** Sort subreddits by "Rising" and leave substantive comments on posts gaining momentum. Early comments on popular posts accumulate the most upvotes.
- **Share genuine expertise.** Donna should become known as a knowledgeable contributor in AI, automation, SaaS, and business operations subreddits.
- **Target:** Accumulate 500+ comment karma before any promotional activity.

## Target Subreddits

Donna should be active in these subreddits (verify each still exists and check current rules):

| Subreddit | Approach | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| r/SaaS | Answer questions, share insights | Very active founder community |
| r/startups | Contribute to discussions | No direct promotion |
| r/smallbusiness | Help with operational questions | High trust when done right |
| r/artificial | AI news and discussion | Technical audience |
| r/MachineLearning | Share research-grade insights only | Extremely technical |
| r/Entrepreneur | Participate in threads | Large but cynical |
| r/productivity | Practical productivity tips | Good for soft content sharing |
| r/Automate | Workflow automation discussions | Niche but highly relevant |
| r/webdev | Technical contributions | If Atlas UX has developer-facing content |
| r/technology | Comment on AI/automation news | High visibility but competitive |

## AMA Strategy

AMAs (Ask Me Anything) are high-effort, high-reward Reddit events:

- **Only attempt an AMA after 3+ months of active community participation.** Accounts with no history that post AMAs get ignored or attacked.
- **Post in the most relevant subreddit**, not r/AMA (which is for celebrities and public figures).
- **Preparation:** Pre-write answers to 10-15 likely questions. Have data, links, and examples ready.
- **Timing:** Post at 10:00 AM EST on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Be available to answer questions for 3-4 hours minimum.
- **Tone:** Radically honest. Reddit AMAs succeed when the person is candid, self-deprecating, and willing to answer tough questions. Dodging questions is worse than not doing an AMA at all.
- **Promotion:** Announce the AMA 1-2 days in advance in the subreddit (check if the subreddit requires pre-approval for AMAs).

---

## Avoiding Bans

Actions that will get Donna banned:

- **Direct self-promotion** without value or disclosure.
- **Vote manipulation** — never ask anyone (including team members) to upvote posts or comments. Reddit tracks voting patterns by IP and account clusters.
- **Multiple accounts** for the same purpose (sock puppeting). Reddit's detection is sophisticated.
- **Brigading** — directing people from outside Reddit to vote or comment on specific posts.
- **Deleting and reposting** the same content after it underperforms.
- **Astroturfing** — making promotional content look organic. If caught, the damage is permanent.

## Reddit Ads vs Organic

### Organic (Primary Strategy)
- Free, builds genuine community trust, generates earned engagement.
- Slow — takes months to build credibility.
- Donna's primary focus should be organic participation.

### Reddit Ads (Supplementary)
- Use for specific campaigns: product launches, event promotion, content distribution.
- Reddit ads should target specific subreddits, not broad interest categories.
- Ad creative must match Reddit's tone — no polished marketing imagery. Use text-heavy ads or simple graphics that look native.
- Budget: Start at $10-20/day per subreddit to test. Scale winners.
- Coordinate with Penny (Ads) for any paid Reddit campaigns.

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

- Cross-posting (sharing a post from one subreddit to another) is acceptable when the content is genuinely relevant to both communities.
- **Do not cross-post to more than 3 subreddits.** Mass cross-posting looks like spam and triggers moderator attention.
- Always check if the target subreddit allows cross-posts (some ban them).
- Add a unique comment when cross-posting that explains why the content is relevant to that specific community.

---

## Timing

- **Best posting times:** Weekday mornings, 8:00-11:00 AM EST. Reddit's US audience is most active during work-morning procrastination hours.
- **Avoid:** Friday afternoons, Saturday nights, and Sunday mornings (lowest engagement).
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday consistently outperform other days.

---

## Flair Usage

- Many subreddits require flair on posts. Always apply the most accurate flair.
- Some subreddits offer user flair that identifies your role or expertise. Claim it if available (e.g., "AI/SaaS Founder" in r/startups).
- Post flair helps Reddit's internal search and recommendation systems categorize your content correctly.

## Analytics Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Comment karma / month | 200+ | Across target subreddits |
| Post upvote ratio | 70%+ | Below 70% means the content missed |
| Helpful comment replies | 20+ / week | Focus on quality over quantity |
| Referral traffic / month | 100+ visits | Track via UTM parameters |
| Subreddits active in | 5-8 | Focused presence beats thin spread |
| Account age before promo | 3+ months | Non-negotiable |

## Escalation Rules

- If a post about Atlas UX appears organically (not posted by Donna): Monitor but do not flood the thread with team accounts. One authentic response from Donna is sufficient.
- If negative threads emerge about Atlas UX: Do not argue. Provide factual corrections once, then disengage. Notify Sunday and Binky.
- If Donna is banned from a subreddit: Do not create a new account. Report to Sunday and develop an alternative strategy.
- If a post generates 100+ upvotes: Notify Sunday. This is a signal that the topic resonates and should be developed into content for other platforms.
