# Marketing Management

## Purpose

This document equips Atlas UX agents — especially Binky (CRO), Sunday (Communications), and the social publisher agents — with frameworks for strategic marketing decision-making. Agents should use these models to evaluate positioning, optimize campaigns, and drive sustainable revenue growth.

## 1. The Marketing Mix (4Ps) — Still the Foundation

### Product

What you sell and the value it delivers. Key decisions:
- **Core benefit**: What problem does it solve?
- **Product levels**: Core benefit → actual product (features, quality, design) → augmented product (warranty, support, brand)
- **Product lifecycle**: Introduction → Growth → Maturity → Decline (each stage demands different marketing strategy)
- **Product portfolio**: Use the BCG Matrix — Stars (high growth, high share), Cash Cows (low growth, high share), Question Marks (high growth, low share), Dogs (low growth, low share)

### Price

What customers pay. Pricing is the most powerful and most underused lever in marketing.
- **Cost-plus**: Add margin to cost. Simple but ignores demand and competition.
- **Value-based**: Price based on perceived value to customer. Requires deep customer understanding. Usually the optimal approach.
- **Competitive**: Match or undercut competitors. Dangerous — leads to margin erosion.
- **Penetration**: Low initial price to gain market share, raise later. Works when network effects or switching costs exist.
- **Skimming**: High initial price, lower over time. Works for innovation with low competition.
- **Freemium**: Free base tier, paid premium. CAC is near-zero but conversion rates typically 2-5%.
- **Dynamic**: Adjust price in real-time based on demand, time, customer segment.

**Price elasticity of demand**: % change in quantity / % change in price. If |ε| > 1, demand is elastic (price cuts increase revenue). If |ε| < 1, demand is inelastic (price increases boost revenue).

### Place (Distribution)

How the product reaches the customer.
- Direct vs indirect channels
- Channel conflict management
- Digital distribution and the zero-marginal-cost economy
- Platform vs marketplace vs direct-to-consumer

### Promotion

How you communicate value. The integrated marketing communications mix:
- Advertising, public relations, personal selling, sales promotion, direct marketing, content marketing, social media, events

## 2. STP Framework

### Segmentation

Divide the total market into distinct groups with different needs, characteristics, or behaviors.

**Segmentation bases**:
- **Demographic**: Age, income, education, occupation, family size
- **Geographic**: Region, city size, climate, urban/rural
- **Psychographic**: Lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes
- **Behavioral**: Usage rate, loyalty, benefits sought, occasion, readiness to buy

**Effective segments must be**: Measurable, accessible, substantial (large enough to be profitable), differentiable, actionable.

### Targeting

Evaluate and select which segments to serve:
- **Undifferentiated**: One offer for the entire market (mass marketing)
- **Differentiated**: Different offers for different segments (most common B2C)
- **Concentrated**: Focus all resources on one segment (niche strategy)
- **Micromarketing**: Customize for individuals (personalization at scale)

**Targeting evaluation criteria**: Segment size and growth, structural attractiveness (Five Forces within the segment), company fit (resources, capabilities, strategic alignment).

### Positioning

Define how the brand occupies a distinct place in the target customer's mind.

**Positioning statement template**:
```
For [target segment] who [need/want],
[Brand] is the [category] that [key benefit]
because [reason to believe].
```

**Positioning strategies**: Attribute, benefit, use/application, competitor, quality/price, user category. The position must be relevant, distinctive, credible, and sustainable.

## 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

The total net profit a company earns from a customer over the entire relationship.

### Simple CLV Formula

```
CLV = (Average Revenue per User × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
```

### Detailed CLV Formula

```
CLV = Σ [Mt × Rt / (1 + d)^t]  for t = 0 to T
```

Where:
- Mt = Margin in period t (revenue minus direct costs)
- Rt = Retention probability in period t
- d = Discount rate
- T = Time horizon

### Practical CLV Calculation

```
Monthly CLV = ARPU × Gross Margin % × (1 / Monthly Churn Rate)
Annual CLV = Monthly CLV × 12
```

### CLV to CAC Ratio

```
LTV:CAC = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Benchmarks**:
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 = Healthy (invest in growth)
- LTV:CAC = 1:1 to 3:1 = Marginal (optimize acquisition or improve retention)
- LTV:CAC < 1:1 = Destroying value (stop spending on this channel/segment)

**Payback period**: CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin). Target: < 12 months for SaaS.

## 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired
```

### CAC Optimization Strategies

1. **Improve conversion rates**: A/B test landing pages, CTAs, onboarding flows
2. **Reduce paid acquisition costs**: Better targeting, higher quality scores, lower CPCs
3. **Increase organic channels**: SEO, content marketing, referral programs, product-led growth
4. **Shorten sales cycles**: Better qualification, self-serve options, remove friction
5. **Increase deal size**: Upsell and cross-sell at acquisition
6. **Channel mix optimization**: Invest more in channels with lowest CAC and highest LTV

### Blended vs Channel CAC

Always calculate both. Blended CAC masks expensive channels subsidized by cheap organic traffic. Evaluate each channel's unit economics independently.

## 5. Brand Equity — Keller's Model

Kevin Lane Keller's Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) pyramid:

### Level 1: Identity — "Who are you?"
**Brand Salience**: Depth and breadth of brand awareness. Can customers recall the brand? In what situations?

### Level 2: Meaning — "What are you?"
**Brand Performance**: How well the product meets functional needs (reliability, durability, service, style, price).
**Brand Imagery**: How the brand meets psychological and social needs (user profiles, purchase situations, personality, values, heritage).

### Level 3: Response — "What about you?"
**Brand Judgments**: Customers' opinions — quality, credibility, consideration, superiority.
**Brand Feelings**: Customers' emotional responses — warmth, fun, excitement, security, social approval, self-respect.

### Level 4: Relationships — "What about you and me?"
**Brand Resonance**: Deepest level — behavioral loyalty, attitudinal attachment, sense of community, active engagement.

### Agent Application

Publisher agents should create content that builds the brand pyramid from bottom to top. Awareness-stage content builds salience; product content builds performance meaning; testimonials build judgments; community content builds resonance.

## 6. The Marketing Funnel

### AIDA Model (Awareness → Interest → Desire → Action)

Each stage requires different content and metrics:

| Stage | Goal | Content Types | Key Metrics |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Awareness** | Get noticed | Blog posts, social media, PR, ads, SEO | Impressions, reach, traffic |
| **Interest** | Educate and engage | Webinars, case studies, email nurture, how-to content | Time on site, email opens, content downloads |
| **Desire** | Create preference | Demos, free trials, comparisons, testimonials, ROI calculators | Trial signups, demo requests, MQLs |
| **Action** | Convert | Landing pages, pricing pages, sales calls, onboarding | Conversion rate, CAC, new customers |

### Modern Funnel Extension: Retention → Advocacy

Post-purchase stages matter as much as pre-purchase in subscription and recurring revenue models.

| Stage | Goal | Tactics | Key Metrics |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Retention** | Keep customers | Onboarding, success programs, feature education, support | Churn rate, NPS, retention rate |
| **Advocacy** | Turn customers into promoters | Referral programs, community, UGC, reviews | NPS, referral rate, organic mentions |

## 7. Digital Marketing Mix

### Content Marketing Strategy

**Content strategy framework**:
1. **Audience**: Who are we creating for? (Use detailed personas)
2. **Goals**: What business outcome does this content drive?
3. **Topics**: What questions does the audience have at each funnel stage?
4. **Formats**: Blog, video, podcast, infographic, tool, template
5. **Distribution**: Owned (blog, email), earned (PR, shares), paid (ads, sponsorships)
6. **Measurement**: Traffic, engagement, conversion, revenue attribution

### SEO Fundamentals

- Technical SEO: Site speed, mobile-friendly, crawlability, structured data
- On-page SEO: Keywords, meta tags, headers, internal linking, content quality
- Off-page SEO: Backlinks, domain authority, social signals
- Content SEO: Topic clusters, pillar pages, search intent matching

### Paid Acquisition

- **Search ads**: High intent, high conversion, expensive CPCs
- **Social ads**: Great for awareness and retargeting, visual creative matters
- **Display/programmatic**: Low CPCs, low conversion, good for retargeting
- **Affiliate**: Performance-based, lower risk, channel management complexity

## 8. Pricing Deep Dive

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Survey customers with four questions to find the optimal price range:
1. At what price would this be too expensive?
2. At what price would this be expensive but still worth considering?
3. At what price would this be a bargain?
4. At what price would this be too cheap (suspect quality)?

Plot the cumulative frequencies. Intersections reveal the acceptable price range and the optimal price point.

### Price Anchoring

Present a higher-priced option first to make subsequent options seem reasonable. The "decoy effect": introduce a third option that makes the target option clearly superior.

### SaaS Pricing Best Practices

- Price on value metric (users, API calls, revenue processed) not features
- Offer 3-4 tiers (Good/Better/Best)
- Annual billing discount (15-20%) to reduce churn and improve cash flow
- Free tier or trial to reduce CAC (product-led growth)
- Transparent pricing builds trust; "contact sales" pricing adds friction

## 9. Marketing Decision Framework for Agents

When evaluating marketing initiatives:

1. **Target segment clarity**: Can you precisely define who this reaches?
2. **Value proposition**: Is the message differentiated and compelling?
3. **Channel fit**: Does the channel match the audience's behavior and the funnel stage?
4. **Unit economics**: Is CAC sustainable relative to CLV for this channel/segment?
5. **Measurement plan**: Can you attribute results to this specific initiative?
6. **Scalability**: If it works, can you increase spend profitably?
7. **Brand consistency**: Does this align with the positioning strategy?
