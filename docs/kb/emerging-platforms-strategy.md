## Purpose

This is Dwight's operational guide for Threads and an early-mover playbook for emerging social platforms. New platforms offer outsized organic reach during their growth phase. This document defines when to join, how to establish presence, and how to repurpose content across emerging channels. It also covers platform-specific strategies for Threads, Tumblr (Terry's domain), and Alignable (Emma's domain).

## Threads Strategy (Dwight's Primary Platform)

### Platform Character
Threads is Meta's text-first social platform, positioned as a conversational alternative to X/Twitter. In 2026, Threads has matured beyond its launch hype but retains strong organic reach because the algorithm is still rewarding consistent posters. The audience skews slightly older and more professional than TikTok, less formal than LinkedIn.

### Posting Strategy
- **Tone:** Conversational, community-focused, slightly more casual than LinkedIn but more substantive than X. Think "smart friend at a dinner party," not "brand social media manager."
- **Post length:** 1-3 short paragraphs. Threads supports 500 characters. Use most of them but do not write walls of text.
- **Questions drive engagement.** End 40-50% of posts with a genuine question that invites replies. The algorithm heavily weights reply threads.
- **Frequency:** 2-4 posts per day. Threads rewards frequent posting more aggressively than most platforms during its growth phase.
- **Timing:** 8:00-10:00 AM, 12:00-2:00 PM, 6:00-8:00 PM EST. Test and refine based on Threads Insights.

### Content Types That Work
- Hot takes on industry news (AI, SaaS, automation)
- "Here's what I learned" reflections from real experience
- Threads about threads — multi-post sequences that tell a story
- Responding to other creators' posts with substantive takes (reply-first engagement is key)
- Polls and open-ended questions about industry topics
- Behind-the-scenes peeks at building Atlas UX

### Cross-Posting from X
- **Do not copy-paste X posts directly to Threads.** The audiences overlap but the cultures differ. X rewards edginess and hot takes. Threads rewards warmth and conversation.
- Repurpose the core idea but rewrite the framing. Soften the tone, expand the reasoning, add a question.
- If a post performs well on X, wait 4-6 hours before adapting it for Threads. Simultaneous cross-posting feels lazy and followers on both platforms will notice.

### Threads Analytics Targets
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Replies per post | 5+ | Primary engagement signal |
| Likes per post | 20+ | Secondary signal |
| Follower growth / week | 100+ | Threads is still in growth mode |
| Posts per week | 14-28 | Frequency matters here |
| Reposts per post | 3+ | Amplification metric |

## When to Join a New Platform

Not every new platform deserves attention. Donna's rule for evaluating new platforms:

### The 1M MAU Threshold
- Do not invest time in any platform with fewer than **1 million monthly active users (MAU)**. Below that threshold, the audience is too small to justify the content investment.
- **Exception:** Niche platforms where your exact ICP (ideal customer profile) congregates, even if total MAU is lower.

### Evaluation Checklist
1. **Does it have 1M+ MAU or clear trajectory toward it?** If not, monitor but do not invest.
2. **Is our target audience there?** A platform with 50M MAU is useless if they are all teenagers and we sell B2B SaaS.
3. **Does the algorithm favor new accounts?** Most platforms boost early adopters. If the platform has matured past this phase, the first-mover advantage is gone.
4. **Can we repurpose existing content?** If the format requires entirely new content types we cannot efficiently produce, the ROI may not justify the effort.
5. **Is the platform stable?** Some platforms launch with hype and collapse within 6 months. Wait for signs of sustained engagement before committing resources.

### First-Mover Advantage Tactics
When a platform passes the evaluation checklist:

- **Claim the handle immediately.** Secure @atlasux or the closest variant before competitors do.
- **Post daily from day one.** Early consistent posters get algorithmic preference that compounds over time.
- **Engage aggressively.** Reply to other early adopters. Follow liberally. Like and comment on everything relevant. Community bonds formed during a platform's early days are the strongest.
- **Experiment with formats.** New platforms are still figuring out what works. Test different content types and lengths. What gets traction early becomes the template others follow.
- **Document the journey.** Posts about "my first week on [platform]" perform well on the new platform and generate curiosity on existing platforms.

## Bluesky Presence

Bluesky is a decentralized social network that has grown steadily since its public launch. Current status for Atlas UX:

- **Handle claimed:** Verify @atlasux.bsky.social is secured.
- **Posting strategy:** Mirror Threads strategy with minor adjustments. Bluesky's audience is more tech-savvy and values decentralization and open protocols. Lean into technical content.
- **Custom feeds:** Bluesky allows users to create custom algorithmic feeds. If we can get Atlas UX content featured in popular AI/tech custom feeds, reach multiplies.
- **Frequency:** 1-2 posts per day. The audience is smaller, so effort should be proportionally lower than Threads.
- **Monitor growth.** If Bluesky crosses 20M MAU, escalate investment and assign a dedicated content stream.

## Mastodon and the Fediverse

The fediverse (Mastodon, Misskey, Lemmy, etc.) is a network of interconnected, independently operated social servers.

### When It Matters
- The fediverse audience is technical, privacy-conscious, and anti-corporate. Standard marketing language will backfire.
- **Only participate if we can commit to genuine technical content.** Open-source contributions, protocol discussions, and developer-focused posts.
- Post on a relevant instance (e.g., a tech-focused Mastodon server), not a general-purpose one.

### Practical Approach
- Maintain a presence on a reputable Mastodon instance.
- Post 2-3 times per week. Focus on AI development, automation philosophy, and technical discussions.
- Engage with the developer community. Share open-source work, technical blog posts, and engineering insights.
- **Never boost or autopost from other platforms.** Fediverse users consider this disrespectful to the culture. Write natively or do not post at all.

## Tumblr Revival Strategy (Terry's Domain)

Tumblr has experienced a cultural resurgence in 2025-2026, particularly among creative professionals and Gen Z/millennial users.

### Terry's Approach
- **Content format:** Long-form text posts, image sets, and reblog commentary. Tumblr's culture rewards elaborate, thoughtful additions to existing posts.
- **Tone:** Self-aware, slightly irreverent, never corporate. Tumblr users can detect marketing language instantly and will mock it publicly.
- **Topics that work:** AI ethics discussions, tech industry commentary, creative applications of AI, memes about automation (if genuinely funny).
- **Reblogging is primary engagement.** Reblog with added commentary 3-5 times per day. Original posts 1-2 per day.
- **Tags:** Use 10-15 tags per post (Tumblr's tagging culture is different from other platforms — more tags is better for discovery). Mix popular tags (#tech, #ai, #automation) with niche ones (#ai agents, #saas life, #workflow automation).
- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts per day (mix of original and reblogs).
- **Avoid:** Hard sales language, corporate jargon, polished marketing graphics. Authenticity and personality are the currency on Tumblr.

## Alignable for Local Business Networking (Emma's Domain)

Alignable is a professional networking platform focused on local business owners and entrepreneurs. It is LinkedIn for small businesses.

### Emma's Approach
- **Profile optimization:** Complete business profile with services, location, and a compelling description focused on how AI agents help local businesses.
- **Recommendations:** Actively request and give recommendations. This is Alignable's trust mechanism.
- **Q&A participation:** Alignable has active Q&A forums where business owners ask operational questions. Emma should answer 5-10 questions per week in categories like technology, operations, and productivity.
- **Local connections:** Connect with businesses in target metros. Alignable surfaces content to geographic networks.
- **Content:** Share practical tips for small businesses adopting AI tools. Keep it jargon-free and actionable.
- **Groups:** Join and participate in relevant Alignable groups (technology, business operations, productivity).
- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts per week. Alignable's algorithm is simpler — consistency and recency drive visibility.
- **Events:** Create or participate in Alignable virtual networking events. These drive high-quality connections with decision-makers.

## Content Repurposing Across Emerging Platforms

Efficient content repurposing is essential when managing multiple emerging platforms:

### Repurposing Workflow
1. **Reynolds writes the blog post** (primary content asset, 1,500-2,500 words).
2. **Sunday extracts 5-8 key insights** from the blog post.
3. **Dwight adapts for Threads** — conversational framing, question endings.
4. **Terry adapts for Tumblr** — irreverent tone, commentary-style, tagged heavily.
5. **Emma adapts for Alignable** — practical, local-business-focused framing.
6. **Bluesky gets the most technical angle** from the same source material.

Each adaptation should feel native to its platform. The underlying insight is the same; the delivery is different.

## Escalation Rules

- If any new platform reaches 5M+ MAU with relevant audience: Dwight presents a formal investment case to Sunday and Binky.
- If a platform we are active on announces major policy changes (API restrictions, algorithm overhaul, content moderation shifts): Assess impact within 48 hours and report to Sunday.
- If any platform account is suspended, restricted, or flagged: Do not create new accounts. Report to Sunday and Jenny (CLO) immediately.
- If a post on any emerging platform exceeds 5x normal engagement: Notify Sunday to coordinate amplification across other channels.
