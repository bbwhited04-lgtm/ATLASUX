# AI Automation Basics

## What Is AI Automation?

AI automation is the use of artificial intelligence systems to perform tasks that would otherwise require human effort. Unlike traditional automation (which follows rigid if-then rules), AI automation can interpret context, make decisions within defined boundaries, and adapt to varying inputs.

In the context of Atlas UX, AI automation means deploying intelligent agents that can research, draft, analyze, create content, manage communications, and execute business operations -- all under strict governance and audit controls.

## How Atlas UX Uses AI Automation

### The Engine Loop

At the heart of Atlas UX is the engine loop -- a separate Node.js process that ticks every 5 seconds (configurable via `ENGINE_TICK_INTERVAL_MS`). Each tick:

1. Checks for queued jobs in the database
2. Evaluates pending workflow triggers
3. Orchestrates agent actions based on priority and dependencies
4. Updates job statuses (queued, running, completed, failed)
5. Logs all activity to the audit trail

### Job Queue System

Work in Atlas UX is organized through a database-backed job queue:

- **Queued**: Job is waiting to be picked up by the engine
- **Running**: Engine is actively processing the job
- **Completed**: Job finished successfully
- **Failed**: Job encountered an error (logged for review)

Jobs can be created manually through the Job Runner interface, triggered by workflows, or generated by agent activity.

### Workflow Automation

Atlas UX includes 100+ predefined workflows organized by function:

- **Daily Intelligence Sweep** (WF-093 to WF-105): 13 agents scan their respective platforms at 05:00-05:36 UTC
- **Daily Executive Brief** (WF-010): Runs at 08:30 UTC with aggregated intelligence
- **Atlas Daily Aggregation** (WF-106): Compiles intel and assigns tasks at 05:45 UTC
- **Social Publishing** (WF-054 to WF-059): Platform-specific content distribution
- **Support Intake** (WF-001): Customer support triage and response
- **Blog Publishing** (WF-108): Content creation with AI-generated featured images

### Multi-Provider AI

Atlas UX is not locked to a single AI provider. The platform routes requests across multiple providers based on task requirements:

| Provider | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| OpenAI | General reasoning, content generation, image creation (DALL-E 3) |
| DeepSeek | Cost-effective reasoning for routine tasks |
| OpenRouter | Access to specialized models |
| Cerebras | High-speed inference for time-sensitive operations |
| Gemini | Long-context summarization and analysis |

## Safety and Governance

Atlas UX applies strict guardrails to all automation:

### Statutory Guardrail Layer (SGL)
Every action is evaluated by SGL before execution. Possible outcomes:
- **ALLOW**: Action proceeds
- **REVIEW**: Action requires human review and legal packet
- **BLOCK**: Action is prohibited (statutory violations, fraud, unauthorized transfers)

### Execution Constitution
- Atlas is the sole executor -- all other agents are advisory
- All state changes emit audit events
- Human authorization is required for regulated actions
- Every approval includes payload hash, timestamp, and approver identity

### Hard Safety Limits
- Recurring purchases blocked by default
- Daily action cap enforced (`MAX_ACTIONS_PER_DAY`)
- Daily posting cap enforced
- Auto-spend limit (`AUTO_SPEND_LIMIT_USD`) triggers approval workflow
- Risk tier 2+ actions require decision memos

## Getting Started with Automation

1. **Connect Your Integrations**: Link Microsoft 365, social platforms, Telegram, and Stripe in Settings
2. **Review Your Agent Roster**: Check which agents are active in the Agents Hub
3. **Start with Workflows**: Enable scheduled workflows that match your business needs
4. **Monitor Activity**: Use the Agent Watcher to observe automation in real time
5. **Adjust Safety Limits**: Configure spend limits and action caps in your environment settings

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Agent | An AI entity with a defined role, tools, and governance policy |
| Workflow | A sequence of agent actions triggered by schedule or event |
| Job | A unit of work queued for engine processing |
| Decision Memo | An approval document required for high-risk actions |
| SGL | Statutory Guardrail Layer -- non-overridable execution boundaries |
| Engine Loop | The 5-second tick process that orchestrates all agent activity |
| Tenant | An isolated organization within the multi-tenant platform |
| Audit Log | Immutable record of every action taken by any agent or user |
