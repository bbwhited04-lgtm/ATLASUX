# Contract Law Fundamentals

## Purpose
This document provides Atlas UX legal agents — particularly Jenny (CLO) — with a comprehensive framework for contract analysis, drafting, review, and enforcement. All autonomous contract decisions must be grounded in the principles below.

## 1. Elements of a Valid Contract

A legally enforceable contract requires five elements. If any element is missing, no contract exists.

### 1.1 Offer
An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, made so that another person is justified in understanding that assent is invited and will conclude the bargain (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 24). An offer must be (a) communicated to the offeree, (b) definite and certain in its terms, and (c) made with the intent to be bound. Advertisements are generally invitations to deal, not offers (Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, 1957, being a narrow exception for specific, clear, and definite ads). An offer can be revoked any time before acceptance unless supported by consideration (option contract) or under UCC Section 2-205 (firm offer by a merchant for goods).

### 1.2 Acceptance
Acceptance must mirror the offer's terms exactly (mirror image rule at common law). Under the UCC Section 2-207, additional or different terms in acceptance between merchants may become part of the contract unless they materially alter it. Acceptance must be communicated by the method specified in the offer or, if none specified, by any reasonable medium. Silence is generally not acceptance (Restatement Section 69, with narrow exceptions for prior dealings). The mailbox rule provides that acceptance is effective upon dispatch, while rejection is effective upon receipt.

### 1.3 Consideration
Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange of legal detriment or benefit (Hamer v. Sidway, 1891). Past consideration is not valid consideration. Adequacy of consideration is generally not scrutinized by courts, but nominal consideration may be insufficient. Pre-existing duty rule: performing an obligation you already owe is not consideration (Stilk v. Myrick, 1809), though UCC Section 2-209 permits good-faith modifications without new consideration for goods contracts. Promissory estoppel (Restatement Section 90) may substitute for consideration where a party reasonably and detrimentally relies on a clear promise.

### 1.4 Capacity
Parties must have legal capacity: they must be of legal age (18 in most jurisdictions), mentally competent, and not under the influence of substances that impair judgment. Contracts with minors are voidable at the minor's election. Corporations must act through authorized agents within their charter powers (ultra vires doctrine).

### 1.5 Legality
The contract's subject matter must be legal. Contracts for illegal purposes are void and unenforceable. Courts will not aid a party to an illegal contract (in pari delicto). Contracts against public policy — such as unreasonable restraints of trade — may be void or reformed.

## 2. Types of Contracts

- **Express contracts**: terms stated explicitly in words (oral or written).
- **Implied-in-fact contracts**: formed by conduct indicating mutual assent (e.g., ordering food in a restaurant).
- **Implied-in-law (quasi-contracts)**: not true contracts; court-imposed obligations to prevent unjust enrichment.
- **Bilateral contracts**: exchange of mutual promises (most commercial contracts).
- **Unilateral contracts**: one party promises in exchange for the other's performance (e.g., reward offers).
- **Executory**: not yet fully performed by both sides.
- **Executed**: fully performed by both sides.

---

## 3. Statute of Frauds

Certain contracts must be evidenced by a signed writing to be enforceable (originally from England's 1677 Statute of Frauds, codified in every US state). The mnemonic MY LEGS covers the main categories:

- **M**arriage: contracts made in consideration of marriage
- **Y**ear: contracts that cannot be performed within one year from formation
- **L**and: contracts for the sale or transfer of interests in real property
- **E**xecutor: promises by an executor to pay estate debts from personal funds
- **G**oods: sale of goods priced at $500 or more (UCC 2-201; revised threshold $5,000 under proposed amendments)
- **S**urety: promises to answer for the debt of another

Exceptions include part performance (real property), specially manufactured goods, merchant confirmatory memoranda (UCC 2-201(2)), and judicial admission.

---

## 4. Parol Evidence Rule

When parties have integrated their agreement into a final written document, prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements that contradict the writing are inadmissible. A **complete integration** bars all extrinsic evidence of prior agreements on the same subject. A **partial integration** bars only contradictory extrinsic evidence, allowing consistent supplementary terms. Exceptions: fraud, duress, mistake, ambiguity, conditions precedent, subsequent modifications, and collateral agreements on separate consideration.

---

## 5. Contract Interpretation

Courts apply a hierarchy of interpretation rules:
1. **Plain meaning rule**: unambiguous terms are given their ordinary meaning.
2. **Four corners doctrine**: the document is interpreted as a whole, without extrinsic evidence, unless ambiguous.
3. **Contra proferentem**: ambiguous terms are construed against the drafter.
4. **Course of dealing, usage of trade, course of performance** (UCC 1-303): industry custom and the parties' own history inform meaning.
5. **Specific terms control general terms**; negotiated terms control boilerplate.
6. **Reasonable interpretation preferred** over unreasonable; interpretation giving effect to all provisions preferred over one rendering terms surplusage.

## 6. Breach of Contract

### 6.1 Material Breach
A material breach goes to the essence of the contract, substantially depriving the non-breaching party of the benefit of the bargain. It excuses further performance by the non-breaching party and entitles them to damages. Factors (Restatement Section 241): extent of deprivation, adequacy of compensation, likelihood of cure, good faith, and hardship.

### 6.2 Minor (Partial) Breach
A minor breach does not defeat the purpose of the contract. The non-breaching party must continue performance but may recover damages for the breach.

### 6.3 Anticipatory Repudiation
When a party unequivocally indicates they will not perform before performance is due (Hochster v. De La Tour, 1853), the other party may: (a) treat the repudiation as a breach and sue immediately, (b) wait and see if performance occurs, or (c) urge retraction. Under UCC 2-610, the aggrieved party may await performance for a commercially reasonable time.

---

## 7. Remedies

### 7.1 Expectation Damages
The default remedy: put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. Formula: loss in value + incidental/consequential damages - costs avoided - losses avoided. Consequential damages must be foreseeable at time of contract (Hadley v. Baxendale, 1854).

### 7.2 Reliance Damages
Restore the non-breaching party to the position they were in before the contract. Used when expectation damages are too speculative.

### 7.3 Restitution
Restore benefits conferred on the breaching party to prevent unjust enrichment. Available even to a breaching party in some jurisdictions (minus damages caused by breach).

### 7.4 Specific Performance
Equitable remedy compelling actual performance. Granted when damages are inadequate — typically for unique goods, real property, or rare assets. Not available for personal services contracts (Thirteenth Amendment concerns).

### 7.5 Liquidated Damages
Enforceable if the amount is a reasonable estimate of anticipated harm and actual damages are difficult to calculate at the time of contracting. If the clause functions as a penalty (disproportionate to actual or anticipated harm), courts will strike it.

## 8. UCC Article 2 — Sale of Goods

Article 2 governs transactions in goods (movable, tangible personal property). Key differences from common law:
- **Open terms permitted**: price, delivery, payment can be left open if parties intend to contract (UCC 2-204).
- **Battle of the forms** (2-207): additional terms in acceptance between merchants become part of contract unless they materially alter it, offer expressly limits acceptance, or objection is given within reasonable time.
- **Implied warranties**: merchantability (2-314), fitness for a particular purpose (2-315).
- **Perfect tender rule** (2-601): buyer may reject goods that fail to conform in any respect (subject to cure provisions under 2-508).
- **Statute of limitations**: four years from tender of delivery (2-725).

## 9. Digital Contracts and E-Signatures

### 9.1 ESIGN Act (15 U.S.C. Section 7001)
The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act provides that electronic signatures and records satisfy legal requirements for signatures and writings. Cannot be denied legal effect solely because they are electronic. Consumer consent requirements apply for transactions where a statute requires written disclosure.

### 9.2 UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act)
Adopted in 49 states (New York has its own ESETA). Provides that electronic records and signatures have the same legal effect as paper equivalents. Applies only to transactions where parties have agreed to conduct business electronically.

### 9.3 Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap
- **Clickwrap agreements** (requiring affirmative click "I agree") are generally enforceable (Feldman v. Google, 2007). Courts look for conspicuous notice and unambiguous assent.
- **Browsewrap agreements** (terms accessible via hyperlink, no affirmative action) are frequently unenforceable unless the user had actual or constructive knowledge (Specht v. Netscape, 2002). Inquiry notice may suffice if the link is conspicuous and the user is a repeat visitor.
- **Sign-in wrap** (hybrid: user must sign in or register, and notice of terms appears near the action button) is increasingly accepted by courts.

## 10. Application to Atlas UX Agent Operations

### Jenny's Contract Review Protocol
1. **Verify all five elements** before treating any agreement as binding.
2. **Flag Statute of Frauds issues**: any agreement expected to last more than one year or involving goods over $500 must be in writing.
3. **Identify integration level**: determine whether the contract is fully or partially integrated before considering extrinsic evidence.
4. **Assess breach materiality**: use the Restatement Section 241 factors before recommending termination or continued performance.
5. **Calculate remedies**: always compute expectation damages first; recommend specific performance only for unique subject matter.
6. **Digital agreement compliance**: all platform terms of service and user agreements must use clickwrap or sign-in wrap (never browsewrap alone). Ensure ESIGN Act consumer consent provisions are satisfied.
7. **Escalation trigger**: any contract over the AUTO_SPEND_LIMIT_USD or with unusual indemnification/limitation of liability clauses must generate a decision_memo for human approval.
8. **UCC awareness**: when reviewing vendor agreements for goods (hosting hardware, office equipment), apply UCC Article 2 rather than common law rules.
9. **Record retention**: all executed contracts must be stored with audit trail entries per Alpha compliance requirements.

### Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Low risk**: standard NDAs, click-through SaaS terms, vendor agreements under spend limit
- **Medium risk**: service agreements with indemnification, contracts with non-standard termination clauses, license agreements
- **High risk**: employment contracts, equity-related agreements, contracts exceeding spend limits, agreements with unlimited liability exposure, multi-year commitments

All high-risk items require a decision_memo with risk tier >= 2.
