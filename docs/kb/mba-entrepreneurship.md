# Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital

## Purpose

This document equips Atlas UX agents — especially Atlas (CEO) and Binky (CRO) — with frameworks for evaluating new ventures, measuring product-market fit, understanding startup economics, and thinking about growth strategy. Whether advising a tenant or managing the Atlas UX platform itself, agents need to think like founders and investors.

## 1. Lean Startup Methodology

Eric Ries adapted lean manufacturing for startups: minimize waste by building only what customers actually want.

### Build-Measure-Learn Loop

```
IDEAS → BUILD (MVP) → PRODUCT → MEASURE (Data) → DATA → LEARN (Insights) → IDEAS
```

The goal is to minimize total time through the loop. Speed of learning determines startup success, not speed of building.

### Key Principles

1. **Validated learning over opinions**: Every hypothesis must be tested with real customer behavior, not just stated preferences
2. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The smallest product that allows you to start the Build-Measure-Learn loop. Not a prototype — a real product with real users and real data
3. **Pivot or persevere**: Based on validated learning, either change direction (pivot) or double down (persevere). Pivots are strategic course corrections, not failures
4. **Innovation accounting**: Measure progress with actionable metrics (conversion, retention, revenue per user), not vanity metrics (total signups, page views, downloads)

### Types of Pivots

| Pivot Type | Change | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Zoom-in** | One feature becomes the whole product | Flickr pivoting from game to photo sharing |
| **Zoom-out** | The product becomes one feature of something larger | Expanding from single tool to platform |
| **Customer segment** | Same product, different customer | Enterprise to SMB or vice versa |
| **Customer need** | Same customer, different problem | Discovering the real pain point |
| **Platform** | App to platform or vice versa | Moving from single application to ecosystem |
| **Business architecture** | High margin/low volume to low margin/high volume | B2B to B2C or vice versa |
| **Value capture** | Change monetization model | Subscription to marketplace to advertising |
| **Channel** | New distribution approach | Direct sales to self-serve to channel partners |
| **Technology** | New technical approach to same problem | On-premise to cloud |

## 2. Business Model Canvas

Alexander Osterwalder's framework captures an entire business model on one page. All nine blocks must be coherent.

### The Nine Blocks

**1. Customer Segments**: Who are we creating value for? Types: mass market, niche market, segmented, diversified, multi-sided platform.

**2. Value Propositions**: What unique value do we deliver? Categories: newness, performance, customization, getting the job done, design, brand/status, price, cost reduction, risk reduction, accessibility, convenience.

**3. Channels**: How do we reach and deliver to customers? Phases: awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery, after-sales. Own vs partner channels.

**4. Customer Relationships**: How do we acquire, retain, and grow customers? Types: personal assistance, dedicated support, self-service, automated, communities, co-creation.

**5. Revenue Streams**: How do we capture value? Models: asset sale, usage fee, subscription, licensing, brokerage, advertising, data monetization.

**6. Key Resources**: What assets do we need? Types: physical, intellectual (IP, brand, data), human, financial.

**7. Key Activities**: What must we do well? Categories: production, problem-solving, platform management, network orchestration.

**8. Key Partnerships**: Who are our essential partners? Types: strategic alliances, coopetition, joint ventures, buyer-supplier relationships. Motivations: optimization, risk reduction, resource acquisition.

**9. Cost Structure**: What are the most important costs? Types: cost-driven vs value-driven. Characteristics: fixed costs, variable costs, economies of scale, economies of scope.

### Canvas Coherence Test

Every block must logically connect. The value proposition must serve the customer segment. Channels must reach those segments. Revenue streams must capture the value delivered. Key resources and activities must enable the value proposition. Cost structure must allow the revenue model to work.

## 3. Product-Market Fit

Marc Andreessen: "Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market."

### How to Find Product-Market Fit

1. **Start with the problem, not the solution**: Deeply understand customer pain. Interview 50+ potential customers before building.
2. **Validate the problem is real**: Customers must be actively spending time, money, or effort on workarounds.
3. **Build for early adopters first**: Not the mainstream market. Find the people who need this most desperately.
4. **Iterate rapidly**: Ship, measure, learn, adjust. Expect 2-4 major iterations before PMF.
5. **Listen to behavior, not words**: What customers do matters more than what they say.

### How to Measure Product-Market Fit

**Sean Ellis Test**: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"
- If 40%+ answer "very disappointed," you have PMF
- 25-40%: Getting close, keep iterating
- Below 25%: Not there yet

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Organic growth accelerating (word of mouth)
- Retention curves flattening (users stick around)
- Usage frequency increasing
- Customers pulling the product from you (inbound demand exceeds capacity)
- Low/declining churn

**Warning signs of false PMF**:
- Growth only from paid acquisition
- High initial engagement but steep drop-off
- Customers using the product but not paying
- Growth in vanity metrics but not revenue

## 4. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Strategy

### MVP is NOT a Crappy Product

An MVP is the smallest thing that lets you test your most critical hypothesis with real customers. It should be:
- **Viable**: Actually solves the core problem well enough that early adopters will use and pay for it
- **Minimum**: Excludes everything that is not essential to testing the current hypothesis
- **A product**: Not a mockup, pitch deck, or landing page (those test interest, not product-market fit)

### MVP Types (Least to Most Built)

| Type | What It Tests | Investment |
|------|--------------|------------|
| **Landing page** | Demand/interest | Hours |
| **Concierge** | Solution viability (manual delivery) | Days |
| **Wizard of Oz** | User experience (manual behind the scenes) | Days-weeks |
| **Single-feature** | Core value proposition | Weeks |
| **Piecemeal** | Full workflow using existing tools | Weeks |
| **Full MVP** | Complete minimum product | Weeks-months |

## 5. Funding Stages

### The Funding Ladder

| Stage | Typical Amount | Valuation Range | What You Need | Key Investors |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | $50K - $500K | $1M - $5M | Idea, team, early prototype | Friends/family, angels, pre-seed funds |
| **Seed** | $500K - $3M | $5M - $15M | MVP, early traction, initial users | Seed funds, angels, micro-VCs |
| **Series A** | $3M - $15M | $15M - $60M | Product-market fit, repeatable sales | Institutional VCs |
| **Series B** | $15M - $50M | $60M - $200M | Scalable growth, unit economics working | Growth VCs |
| **Series C+** | $50M+ | $200M+ | Market leadership, path to IPO/exit | Late-stage VCs, crossover funds, PE |

### What Investors Look For At Each Stage

- **Pre-Seed/Seed**: Team quality, market size, insight uniqueness, early signals
- **Series A**: Product-market fit evidence, retention metrics, repeatable acquisition
- **Series B**: Scalable growth engine, unit economics, organizational maturity
- **Series C+**: Market dominance, profitability path, competitive moat, IPO readiness

## 6. Startup Valuation Methods

### Pre-Revenue Methods

**Berkus Method**: Assign up to $500K for each of five risk factors:
1. Sound idea (basic value)
2. Prototype (reduces technology risk)
3. Quality management team (reduces execution risk)
4. Strategic relationships (reduces market risk)
5. Product rollout or sales (reduces production risk)

Maximum pre-revenue valuation: $2.5M

**Scorecard Method**: Compare to median pre-money valuation of similar startups, then adjust:
- Team: 0-30% weight
- Market size: 0-25% weight
- Product/technology: 0-15% weight
- Competitive environment: 0-10% weight
- Marketing/sales: 0-10% weight
- Need for additional investment: 0-5% weight
- Other factors: 0-5% weight

### Post-Revenue Methods

**Revenue multiples**: Enterprise Value / ARR. SaaS multiples vary 5-25x based on growth rate, retention, and margins.

**DCF**: Project cash flows 5-10 years, discount at WACC. Less reliable for early-stage companies due to uncertain projections.

**Comparable transactions**: Recent M&A deals and funding rounds for similar companies.

## 7. Unit Economics

The financial metrics that determine whether a business model works at the individual customer level.

### Core Unit Economics

```
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = Total S&M Spend / New Customers
Lifetime Value (LTV) = ARPU × Gross Margin % × (1 / Churn Rate)
LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly ARPU × Gross Margin %)
```

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Great | Red Flag |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| LTV:CAC | > 3:1 | > 5:1 | < 1:1 |
| CAC Payback | < 18 months | < 12 months | > 24 months |
| Gross Margin | > 60% | > 75% | < 50% |
| Net Dollar Retention | > 100% | > 120% | < 90% |
| Logo Churn (monthly) | < 3% | < 1% | > 5% |

### Growth Metrics

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**:
```
MRR = Existing MRR + New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR - Contraction MRR
```

**Net Dollar Retention (NDR)**:
```
NDR = (Beginning MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Beginning MRR
```
NDR > 100% means you grow even without acquiring new customers.

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: MRR × 12. The primary valuation metric for SaaS.

**Quick Ratio** (SaaS):
```
SaaS Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR)
```
Target: > 4 (adding $4 in new/expansion for every $1 lost).

## 8. The Rule of 40

For SaaS companies:
```
Revenue Growth Rate (%) + Profit Margin (%) ≥ 40%
```

Examples:
- 50% growth + -10% margin = 40 (acceptable)
- 20% growth + 20% margin = 40 (acceptable)
- 10% growth + 5% margin = 15 (below benchmark)

This framework allows high-growth companies to be unprofitable and profitable companies to grow slowly, as long as the combination meets the threshold.

## 9. Pitch Deck Structure

For when agents need to understand or create investment narratives:

1. **Problem**: What pain exists? How big is it?
2. **Solution**: How do you solve it?
3. **Market Size**: TAM, SAM, SOM with bottom-up calculation
4. **Product**: Demo or screenshots
5. **Traction**: Metrics that prove demand
6. **Business Model**: How you make money
7. **Competition**: Positioning matrix (why you win)
8. **Team**: Why this team wins this market
9. **Financials**: Unit economics, projections, key assumptions
10. **Ask**: How much, what milestones, use of funds

### Market Sizing

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): Total market demand for the product category
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): TAM segment you can reach with your current business model
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): SAM you can realistically capture in the near term

Always use bottom-up calculation (number of customers × average revenue per customer) rather than top-down ("if we get 1% of a $100B market"). Investors see through top-down sizing.

## 10. Entrepreneurial Decision Framework for Agents

When evaluating ventures or growth initiatives:

1. **Problem validation**: Is the problem real, urgent, and underserved?
2. **Solution fit**: Does the solution address the root cause?
3. **Market size**: Is the TAM large enough to build a significant business?
4. **Unit economics**: Do LTV:CAC and payback work at scale?
5. **Competitive advantage**: What moat prevents commoditization?
6. **Team-market fit**: Does the team have unique insight into this problem?
7. **Timing**: Why now? What changed to make this possible/necessary?
8. **Capital efficiency**: How much capital is needed to reach key milestones?
