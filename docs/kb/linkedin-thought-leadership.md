## Purpose

This is Link's operational guide for building Atlas UX's presence on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is the primary channel for B2B credibility, talent attraction, and enterprise lead generation. Every post should position Atlas UX as a thought leader in AI-driven business operations.

---

## B2B Content Pillars

All LinkedIn content should fall into one of these five pillars:

1. **AI & Automation Insights** — Original perspectives on how AI agents transform business operations. Not hype — practical implications backed by real-world data.
2. **Product Leadership** — Behind-the-scenes looks at how we build Atlas UX. Engineering decisions, design philosophy, agent architecture. Show the craft.
3. **Industry Analysis** — Commentary on SaaS trends, enterprise AI adoption, workflow automation shifts. Always include our unique angle.
4. **Culture & Team** — How we work, what we value, hiring philosophy. Humanize the brand. This pillar drives talent pipeline.
5. **Customer Success** — Case studies, use-case breakdowns, and results stories (anonymized if needed). Proof over promises.

Rotate across pillars weekly. Never let any single pillar dominate for more than 2 consecutive posts.

## Company Page vs Personal Brand

Both matter. They serve different purposes:

### Company Page
- Official announcements, product updates, job postings, and company milestones.
- Post 3-4 times per week.
- Tone: Professional but not stiff. Authoritative. Use "we" voice.
- Employees engaging with company posts (liking, commenting within the first hour) dramatically boosts organic reach.

### Personal Brand (Founder/Exec Accounts)
- Thought leadership, hot takes, personal stories, lessons learned.
- Post 4-5 times per week from key executive accounts.
- Tone: First person, conversational, vulnerable when appropriate.
- Personal accounts get 5-10x the organic reach of company pages. Prioritize personal brand content and link back to the company page.

## Post Formats (Ranked by Engagement)

1. **Document/Carousel Posts** — PDF uploads that create swipeable carousels. Highest engagement format on LinkedIn in 2026. 8-12 slides, one idea per slide, strong visual design. Use for frameworks, step-by-step guides, and data presentations.
2. **Text-Only Posts** — Still powerful when the writing is sharp. 1,200-1,800 characters is the sweet spot. Use line breaks aggressively — no wall of text. Start with a hook line that creates curiosity.
3. **Native Video** — 1-3 minutes, vertical or square. Captions mandatory. Best for founder stories, product demos, and industry commentary.
4. **Polls** — Great for engagement but low-value for brand building. Use 1-2 per month max. Polls with surprising or counterintuitive options perform best.
5. **Articles/Newsletter** — Long-form content published directly on LinkedIn. Lower immediate reach but strong for SEO and evergreen discovery. Publish 1-2 articles per month.
6. **Link Posts** — Lowest reach. LinkedIn penalizes posts that send users off-platform. When sharing links, use the link-in-comment strategy.

---

## LinkedIn Newsletter

- Publish a weekly or biweekly newsletter directly on LinkedIn.
- **Topic focus:** Deep-dive analysis that is too long for a regular post.
- Newsletter subscribers get push notifications — this is the only way to guarantee visibility on LinkedIn.
- Target 500+ subscribers in the first 3 months.
- Every newsletter edition should end with a question to drive comments.

---

## Posting Frequency and Timing

- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts per week on the company page. Do not post on weekends — LinkedIn engagement drops 60% on Saturday/Sunday.
- **Best times:** Tuesday through Thursday, 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM, or 5:00-6:00 PM in the target audience's timezone.
- **Spacing:** Minimum 18 hours between posts. Posting twice in one day cannibalizes reach.
- **Consistency matters more than volume.** Three excellent posts per week beats seven mediocre ones.

---

## Hashtag Usage

- Use **3-5 hashtags** per post. Fewer is fine; more than 5 looks spammy.
- Place hashtags at the bottom of the post, separated from the main content.
- Mix specificity levels:
  - 1 broad: #ArtificialIntelligence, #SaaS, #FutureOfWork
  - 2-3 medium: #AIAutomation, #BusinessProductivity, #WorkflowAutomation
  - 1 branded: #AtlasUX
- Track which hashtags drive the most impressions monthly and rotate underperformers.

## Commenting Strategy for Visibility

Commenting on other people's posts is as important as publishing your own:

- **Target:** Leave 10-15 substantive comments per day on posts from industry leaders, potential customers, and peers.
- **Substantive means:** 3+ sentences that add a new perspective, share a relevant experience, or respectfully challenge the post. Never write "Great post!" or "Love this!" — these are invisible.
- **Timing:** Comment within the first hour of a post going live. Early comments get more visibility as the post gains traction.
- **Strategic targets:** Follow and engage with 50-100 accounts in our ICP (ideal customer profile). Consistent commenting builds familiarity before any sales conversation.

---

## Engagement Pods — Hard No

Do not participate in engagement pods (groups that artificially like/comment on each other's posts). LinkedIn's algorithm detects coordinated engagement patterns and penalizes accounts involved. The short-term boost is not worth the long-term suppression.

---

## Connection Requests and InMail

### Connection Requests
- Always include a personalized note (300 character limit).
- Reference something specific: a post they wrote, a mutual connection, a shared interest.
- Never pitch in the connection request. The goal is to connect, not sell.
- Target 20-30 strategic connection requests per week.

### InMail
- Reserve InMail for high-value prospects who have not accepted connection requests.
- Keep it under 100 words. One clear question or value proposition.
- Mention a specific pain point relevant to their role or industry.
- InMail open rates are highest on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.

## Content Formatting Rules

- **First line is everything.** LinkedIn truncates posts after ~210 characters with a "see more" link. The first line must create enough curiosity to earn the click.
- Use single-sentence paragraphs and line breaks. Dense paragraphs are skipped.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for scannable content.
- Emojis: Use sparingly (1-2 per post max). Bullet-point emojis are acceptable. Excessive emoji use undermines professional credibility.
- Never use all caps for entire sentences. Bold claims speak for themselves.

---

## Escalation Rules

- If a post generates debate (20+ comments with opposing views): Monitor but do not engage defensively. Notify Sunday for messaging guidance.
- If a competitor directly mentions or challenges us in a post: Do not respond publicly without Sunday and Binky approval.
- If a post goes viral (10x normal impressions): Notify Sunday and Binky immediately. Prepare a follow-up post to capitalize on momentum within 24 hours.
