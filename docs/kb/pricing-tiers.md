## Billing FAQ

**When am I charged?**
Monthly plans are billed on the same date each month. Annual plans are billed upfront for the full year.

**Can I change plans?**
Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle.

**What happens if I exceed my action limit?**
Actions beyond your daily limit are queued for the next day. No overage charges — the system pauses rather than billing extra.

**Is there a free trial for paid tiers?**
The Starter tier is permanently free and serves as the trial experience. Upgrade when you are ready.

**How does per-seat billing work?**
Business and Enterprise tiers charge per active user seat. Seats can be added or removed at any time with prorated billing.

## Key Takeaways

1. Four tiers from free to enterprise cover all organization sizes.
2. Per-seat pricing for Business and Enterprise scales with your team.
3. Annual billing saves 20% across all paid tiers.
4. Action limits are soft caps — work is queued, not billed as overage.
5. Enterprise pricing is lower per-seat due to volume commitment requirements.
