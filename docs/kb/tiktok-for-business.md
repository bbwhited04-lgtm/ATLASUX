## Purpose

This is Timmy's operational playbook for TikTok. TikTok is the highest-reach organic platform in 2026 for brand discovery. The algorithm is content-first, not follower-first — meaning a single video from a zero-follower account can reach millions. This guide covers hook strategy, content creation, posting cadence, TikTok SEO, and analytics.

## The First 3 Seconds (Hook Strategy)

The hook is everything. TikTok's algorithm measures watch time as the primary ranking signal. If viewers scroll past in the first 3 seconds, the video is dead.

### Proven Hook Formats

- **Pattern interrupt:** Start with unexpected motion, a loud sound, or an unusual visual. Break the viewer's scrolling rhythm.
- **Bold claim:** "Most businesses waste 40% of their time on tasks AI can do for free." Make them want to verify.
- **Direct address:** "If you run a business and you're not using AI agents, watch this." Calls out the target audience instantly.
- **Before/after:** Show the "after" result first. "Here's what happened when we automated our entire sales pipeline." Then rewind.
- **Question hook:** "Why are SaaS founders switching to autonomous AI employees?" Unanswered questions create an open loop.
- **Controversy hook:** "Unpopular opinion: your VA is already obsolete." Disagreement drives comments, which drives reach.

### What to Avoid
- Starting with "Hey guys" or "Welcome back" — these are skip triggers.
- Starting with a logo or brand intro — nobody cares about your brand in the first 3 seconds.
- Slow pans, establishing shots, or anything that delays the point.

## Trending Audio

- **Use trending audio when it fits naturally.** Trending sounds signal freshness to the algorithm and place your video in the sound's discovery feed.
- Check the TikTok Creative Center daily for trending sounds in your niche.
- **Original audio is fine for talking-head content.** Do not force a trending sound onto content where it does not belong.
- When using trending audio, the visual content must still deliver value. Do not rely on the audio alone.
- Save trending sounds to your library when you spot them — they have a 1-2 week peak window.

---

## Posting Cadence

- **Target:** 1-3 videos per day. Consistency matters more than perfection.
- **Minimum:** 5 videos per week. Below this threshold, the algorithm deprioritizes the account.
- **Spacing:** Post at least 3 hours apart. Back-to-back posts compete with each other.
- **Best posting times:** 7:00-9:00 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM, and 7:00-9:00 PM EST.
- Saturday and Sunday perform well on TikTok (unlike LinkedIn). Do not skip weekends.

## Hashtag Strategy

The #fyp debate: Adding #fyp, #foryou, or #foryoupage does not meaningfully impact reach. These tags are so saturated they provide zero discovery signal. Skip them.

### Effective Hashtag Use
- Use **3-5 hashtags** per video.
- Mix niche-specific and medium-volume tags:
  - Niche: #AIAgents, #BusinessAutomation, #SaaSFounder
  - Medium: #AItools, #Productivity, #TechTok, #WorkSmarter
  - Branded: #AtlasUX
- Place hashtags in the caption, not the comments.
- Hashtags on TikTok function more like topic labels for the algorithm than discovery tools for users. Choose tags that accurately describe the content category.

## Duets and Stitches

These are high-engagement formats that piggyback on existing viral content:

### Stitches
- Stitch the first 5 seconds of a viral video, then provide your expert reaction, correction, or expansion.
- Best for: Responding to misinformation, adding depth to surface-level advice, or applying a hot take to our niche.
- Target 2-3 stitches per week.

### Duets
- React side-by-side with another creator's content.
- Best for: Agreeing with and amplifying good advice, showing a demo alongside someone's question, or adding a B2B perspective to consumer content.
- Target 1-2 duets per week.

Always credit the original creator. Never stitch or duet content from competitors in a way that gives them free promotion.

## Video Length Sweet Spots

TikTok rewards completion rate. Shorter videos are easier to complete, but longer videos generate more total watch time.

- **15-30 seconds:** Best for punchy tips, hot takes, and quick product demos. Aim for 80%+ completion rate.
- **30-60 seconds:** The sweet spot for tutorial content, listicles, and storytelling. Aim for 50%+ completion rate.
- **1-3 minutes:** Use for in-depth walkthroughs, case studies, and narrative content. Aim for 30%+ completion rate.
- **Over 3 minutes:** Only for exceptionally compelling content. TikTok supports up to 10-minute videos but most business content does not warrant that length.

When in doubt, cut shorter. A 30-second video that gets watched twice is better than a 2-minute video that gets abandoned at 15 seconds.

## TikTok SEO (Keyword-Rich Captions)

TikTok is a search engine. Users search for topics directly in-app. Optimize for this:

- **Write captions as if they are search queries.** Instead of "Check this out," write "How to automate your business with AI agents in 2026."
- Include keywords naturally: AI automation, business productivity, SaaS tools, workflow automation.
- TikTok's search results surface videos based on caption text, on-screen text, and spoken words (auto-transcribed).
- Use on-screen text overlays that include your target keywords.
- Say your keywords out loud in the video. TikTok's speech recognition indexes spoken content.

---

## TikTok Shop Integration

If/when Atlas UX has products or subscriptions available through TikTok Shop:

- Tag products directly in videos for in-app checkout.
- Product review and tutorial content converts best.
- LIVE shopping sessions drive impulse purchases — schedule 1-2 per week during peak hours.
- Coordinate with Penny (Ads) for any paid promotion of shop content.

Until TikTok Shop is active, focus on driving traffic to bio link using CTAs like "Link in bio for the free trial."

## Escalation Rules

- If a video breaks 100K views: Notify Sunday and Binky. Prepare a follow-up video within 24 hours that references the viral one.
- If comments turn negative or controversial (20+ negative comments): Pause replies and escalate to Sunday.
- If TikTok flags or removes content: Do not repost. Notify Sunday and Jenny (CLO) to review the content against community guidelines.
- If a creator with 500K+ followers duets or stitches our content: Notify Sunday immediately for response strategy.
