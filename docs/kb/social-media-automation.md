# Social Media Automation

## Overview

Atlas UX deploys 13 dedicated social publisher agents, each specializing in a specific platform. These agents are coordinated by Sunday (Communications & Technical Documentation lead), who reports to Binky (CRO). All social activity follows the platform's chain-of-command: content is drafted by the specialist, reviewed through the approval pipeline, and published only after Atlas (CEO) authorization.

## The Social Publisher Team

## How Social Automation Works

### Daily Intelligence Sweep (05:00-05:36 UTC)

Every morning, workflows WF-093 through WF-105 execute a coordinated platform intelligence sweep:

1. Each social publisher scans their platform for trends, competitor activity, and engagement data
2. Reports are compiled and sent to their direct leader (Sunday)
3. Sunday aggregates findings into a communications brief
4. At 05:45 UTC, WF-106 fires: Atlas reviews all intel and assigns daily tasks

### Content Creation Pipeline

1. **Research Phase**: Binky and Archy identify topics based on market intelligence and audience data
2. **Drafting Phase**: Sunday assigns content topics to the relevant social publishers
3. **Image/Video Phase**: Venny generates visual assets; Victor handles video where needed
4. **Review Phase**: Drafted content enters the approval queue with decision memos for Atlas
5. **Publishing Phase**: Atlas approves and executes publication to the target platform
6. **Monitoring Phase**: Agents track engagement metrics and report back

### Blog-to-Social Distribution

When Reynolds publishes a blog post (WF-108):

1. Reynolds drafts the article with SEO optimization
2. Venny generates a brand-consistent featured image (navy/cyan palette via DALL-E 3)
3. Atlas reviews and approves the post
4. The blog URL is distributed to social publishers for platform-specific promotion
5. Each publisher adapts the content for their platform (thread for X, article for LinkedIn, pin for Pinterest)

## Safety and Governance

### Publishing Constraints
- No agent may publish without Atlas approval
- Daily posting cap enforced per platform
- All published content logged to audit trail
- No fabricated trends or engagement manipulation

### Content Integrity
Per the Atlas UX Soul document:
- No fake viral hacks
- No engagement manipulation
- No algorithm exploitation through deception
- No manufactured outrage
- No fear-based marketing

### SGL Compliance
Social publishing actions are evaluated by the Statutory Guardrail Layer:
- Copyright-infringing content is BLOCKED
- Deceptive claims are BLOCKED
- Brand-sensitive content requires REVIEW
- Standard content that passes all checks is ALLOWED

## Configuration

### Enabling Social Automation
1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
2. Connect each social platform account via OAuth
3. Enable the relevant agent workflows in the Agents Hub
4. Set posting preferences (frequency, time zones, content types)

### Managing Content Approval
- Low-risk content: Auto-approved if confidence threshold is met
- Medium-risk content: Flagged for quick review
- High-risk content: Full decision memo with Atlas approval required
- Configure risk thresholds in the Business Manager > Decisions tab

### Monitoring Performance
- **Agent Watcher**: Real-time view of social publishing activity
- **Business Manager > Intelligence**: Impressions, CTR, conversions, channel ROI
- **Audit Log**: Complete history of all published content with timestamps

## Workflow Customization

You can modify social automation behavior:

- **Posting Schedule**: Adjust workflow trigger times in the scheduler configuration
- **Content Templates**: Define brand voice guidelines per platform in the Knowledge Base
- **Approval Thresholds**: Tune auto-approval confidence levels per content type
- **Platform Priority**: Allocate more workflow slots to high-performing platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Posting
- Check that the platform integration is connected in Settings
- Verify the agent's workflow is enabled
- Check the job queue for failed jobs
- Review audit log for SGL BLOCK entries

### Content Quality Issues
- Update brand guidelines in the Knowledge Base
- Provide more specific prompts when assigning content tasks
- Review and refine content templates for each platform

### Rate Limiting
- Social platforms enforce their own rate limits
- Atlas UX respects platform limits and queues excess content
- Check the Agent Watcher for rate-limit-related job delays
