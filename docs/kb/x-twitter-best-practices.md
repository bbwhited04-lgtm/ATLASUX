## Purpose

This is Kelly's operational playbook for publishing on X (formerly Twitter). It covers thread strategy, engagement timing, hashtag discipline, API constraints, and analytics targets. Every post Kelly publishes should be measured against these standards.

## Thread Strategy

Threads are the highest-reach format on X in 2026. Structure every thread as follows:

1. **Hook tweet** — A bold claim, surprising stat, or provocative question. This is the only tweet most people see. It must stop the scroll. Never open with "Thread:" or "1/".
2. **Value body (3-7 tweets)** — Each tweet delivers one standalone insight. Use short paragraphs, line breaks, and numbered lists. Every tweet should be quotable on its own.
3. **CTA tweet** — End with a clear ask: follow, bookmark, reply with their take, or visit a link. Place the link in the final tweet, not the hook (links in the first tweet get suppressed by the algorithm).

Keep individual tweets between 200-260 characters for optimal engagement. Tweets under 100 characters feel throwaway; tweets over 260 feel dense in the timeline.

## Engagement Timing (EST)

Post during these windows for maximum impressions:

- **Morning rush:** 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM EST (commuters, morning scroll)
- **Lunch break:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM EST (quick-check behavior)
- **Evening wind-down:** 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM EST (highest engagement window)

Avoid posting between 10 PM - 6 AM EST unless targeting international audiences. Weekday engagement outperforms weekends by 15-20% for B2B content. For consumer content, Saturday mornings (9-11 AM) can perform well.

## Trending Topic Strategy

Hijacking trending topics is high-risk, high-reward. Rules:

- **Only join trends that intersect with our domain** (AI, productivity, business automation, SaaS). Forced relevance is transparent and damages credibility.
- **Add genuine value** — Do not just parrot the trending phrase. Offer a unique take, data point, or angle that connects the trend to our expertise.
- **Move fast** — Trending topics have a 2-4 hour window of peak visibility. If you cannot publish within that window, skip it.
- **Never touch** — Tragedies, political controversies, social justice movements (unless directly relevant to our mission), celebrity drama. The risk-reward ratio is never favorable.

---

## Hashtag Discipline

- Use **2-3 hashtags maximum** per tweet. More than 3 reduces engagement by 17%.
- Place hashtags at the end of the tweet, not inline (inline hashtags break reading flow).
- Rotate between branded (#AtlasUX, #AIEmployee) and discovery hashtags (#AIAutomation, #SaaS, #FutureOfWork).
- Never use generic high-volume hashtags like #motivation or #success — they attract bots, not customers.
- Check hashtag performance weekly and retire any that generate impressions but zero profile visits.

---

## Reply and Quote Tweet Strategy

- **Reply to every reply within 2 hours** during business hours. The algorithm rewards active conversations.
- **Quote tweet** industry news, customer wins, and partner content. Add 2-3 sentences of original commentary — never quote tweet with just an emoji or "This."
- **Reply to large accounts** in our niche with substantive comments (not sycophantic). If they engage back, that reply becomes visible to their entire audience.
- Target 5-10 strategic replies per day to accounts with 10K+ followers in AI/SaaS/productivity spaces.

## API v2 Rate Limits

Kelly must respect these hard constraints:

| Action | Limit | Window |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Create tweet | 50 tweets | per 24 hours (app-level) |
| Create tweet | 300 tweets | per 15 minutes (user-level, theoretical) |
| Retweets | 50 | per 24 hours |
| Likes | 100 | per 24 hours |
| Direct messages | 500 | per 24 hours |

In practice, Kelly should never post more than **8-12 tweets per day** (including thread tweets). Spacing tweets 45-90 minutes apart prevents timeline flooding and algorithmic suppression. Reserve API capacity for replies and engagement activity.

---

## Media Best Practices

- **Images:** 1200x675px (16:9) for single images. Use brand colors and readable text overlay. Alt text is mandatory for accessibility and SEO.
- **Video:** 30-60 seconds, square (1:1) or vertical (9:16). Autoplay is silent — burn in captions.
- **GIFs:** Use sparingly and only when they genuinely enhance the message.
- Tweets with media get 150% more retweets than text-only. Always attach media when possible.

## Analytics Targets

Track these metrics weekly and report to Sunday:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Impressions per tweet | 500+ | Baseline for a growing account |
| Profile visits / week | 200+ | Indicates curiosity beyond the tweet |
| Link clicks / week | 50+ | Measures traffic-driving effectiveness |
| Engagement rate | 2-5% | (Likes + replies + retweets + clicks) / impressions |
| Follower growth / week | 50+ net | Track unfollows too |
| Reply rate | 80%+ | Percentage of replies answered within 2 hours |

If impressions are high but profile visits are low, the content is entertaining but not building brand curiosity — adjust toward more opinionated or expertise-driven posts.

---

## Content Mix

- **40%** Original insights, hot takes, and expertise (builds authority)
- **25%** Curated industry news with commentary (builds trust)
- **20%** Product/feature highlights with real use cases (drives awareness)
- **10%** Community engagement — polls, questions, reply threads (builds connection)
- **5%** Direct promotional (launches, offers, CTAs)

Never exceed 10% direct promotional content. The audience will self-select out.

## Escalation Rules

- If a tweet generates negative backlash (10+ negative replies in 1 hour), pause and escalate to Sunday before responding.
- If an account with 100K+ followers engages (positive or negative), notify Sunday immediately.
- Never delete tweets unless they contain factual errors, typos, or broken links. Deleting controversial-but-accurate takes looks weak.
