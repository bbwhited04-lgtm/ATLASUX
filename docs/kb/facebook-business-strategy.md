## Purpose

This is Fran's operational guide for managing the Atlas UX Facebook Business Page. It covers content formats, posting cadence, community management, algorithm mechanics, and Meta Business Suite integration. Facebook remains the largest social platform by MAU and the most important channel for reaching decision-makers aged 30-55.

## Content Formats — What to Use and When

### Reels (Highest Organic Reach)
- Facebook heavily prioritizes Reels in 2026. They receive 2-3x the organic reach of static posts.
- **Length:** 30-60 seconds (sweet spot is 45 seconds).
- **Format:** Vertical (9:16), 1080x1920px minimum.
- **Hook:** First 3 seconds must grab attention — start with motion, text overlay, or a direct question.
- **Audio:** Use trending audio when it fits naturally. Original audio with captions works for B2B.
- **Post 3-4 Reels per week minimum.**

### Static Image Posts
- Best for announcements, quotes, data visualizations, and product screenshots.
- Use carousels (multiple images) for step-by-step content — they get 1.4x more engagement than single images.
- **Dimensions:** 1200x630px for link shares, 1080x1080px for standalone images.
- **Post 3-5 static posts per week.**

### Stories
- 24-hour ephemeral content. Use for behind-the-scenes, polls, quick updates, and event countdowns.
- Stories keep the page "active" in followers' story trays, which signals freshness to the algorithm.
- **Post 2-3 stories per day** on active days.

### Link Posts
- Lowest organic reach of any format. The algorithm deprioritizes off-platform links.
- When sharing links, put the link in the first comment instead of the post body. Write the post as native content with a "link in comments" CTA.
- Reserve link posts for high-value content (blog posts, product launches, press mentions).

---

## Posting Cadence

- **1-2 posts per day** on the main feed. More than 2 per day cannibalizes reach on each post.
- **Spacing:** Minimum 4 hours between feed posts.
- **Best posting times:** 9:00 AM, 1:00 PM, and 6:00 PM EST (test and refine with Page Insights).
- **Weekends:** Reduce to 1 post per day. Saturday and Sunday engagement is lower for B2B but can work for lifestyle content.

---

## Boosting Strategy

Not every post should be boosted. Follow these rules:

- **Boost criteria:** Only boost posts that achieve 3%+ organic engagement rate in the first 2 hours.
- **Budget:** $5-15 per boost for testing. Scale to $25-50 for proven performers.
- **Duration:** 3-5 days per boost. Shorter runs prevent ad fatigue.
- **Audience:** Start with engaged followers + lookalike audiences. Narrow by job title, industry, and interests for B2B.
- **Never boost:** Posts with typos, underperforming content (trying to "save" it), or anything purely promotional without value.
- Coordinate with Penny (Ads specialist) for campaigns exceeding $50.

## Community Management

Response time is a ranking signal. Facebook displays response rate on Business Pages.

- **Target:** Respond to all comments and messages within **1 hour** during business hours (8 AM - 8 PM EST).
- **After hours:** Respond within 4 hours. Use auto-responder for DMs outside business hours.
- **Comment strategy:**
  - Acknowledge every comment, even single-emoji reactions — a like or brief reply counts.
  - Ask follow-up questions to drive comment depth. Deeper threads signal high engagement to the algorithm.
  - Negative comments: Respond professionally once. Do not argue. If abusive, hide (do not delete — hidden comments are only visible to the poster and their friends).
- **DMs:** Treat every DM as a potential lead. Route product questions to the appropriate agent (Sandy for bookings, Cheryl for support).

---

## Facebook Groups Strategy

Groups have 5-6x the organic reach of Page posts. Use them strategically:

- **Own a group:** Create a branded community group (e.g., "AI-Powered Business Owners"). Post valuable content 3-4x per week. Do not make it a promotional channel — 90% value, 10% brand mentions.
- **Participate in niche groups:** Join 5-10 groups in our target verticals (SaaS founders, AI enthusiasts, small business owners). Contribute genuinely for 2-3 weeks before ever mentioning Atlas UX. Answer questions. Share expertise. Build reputation first.
- **Never spam groups.** One promotional post in a group you do not own can result in a permanent ban and damage brand reputation.

## Algorithm Signals (Priority Order)

Facebook's algorithm weights engagement signals in this order:

1. **Comments** — especially long comments and comment replies (conversations)
2. **Shares** — the highest-value signal; means the content is worth endorsing
3. **Reactions** — Love and Wow reactions weighted higher than Like
4. **Click-through** — clicks on links, images, or "see more"
5. **Watch time** — for video/Reels, percentage watched matters more than views
6. **Saves** — a newer signal; indicates reference-worthy content

Write posts that invite comments. End posts with direct questions. Use "tell me" and "what's your take" language. Avoid engagement bait phrases Facebook penalizes ("Like if you agree", "Share with a friend who...").

---

## Content Mix

Follow the 80/20 rule strictly:

- **80% value content:** Educational posts, industry insights, how-tos, case studies, community discussions, curated news with commentary, polls, behind-the-scenes.
- **20% promotional:** Product features, launches, testimonials, offers, CTAs to sign up or demo.

Within the 80% value bucket, rotate between these pillars:
- Industry trends and news (with our perspective)
- Tips and tutorials (AI automation, productivity, business ops)
- Community stories and wins
- Data and research (original if possible)

---

## Event Creation

Facebook Events still drive strong organic reach and notifications.

- Create events for webinars, product launches, AMAs, and community meetups.
- Post the event 2 weeks in advance. Share it 3-4 times leading up to the date.
- Use the event discussion tab to build anticipation and engage registrants.
- After the event, post a recap with key takeaways and a link to the recording.

---

## Meta Business Suite Integration

All scheduling and analytics should flow through Meta Business Suite:

- **Schedule posts** 1-3 days in advance. This allows review by Sunday before publication.
- **Inbox management:** Monitor the unified inbox for comments, DMs, and Instagram mentions.
- **Insights to track weekly:**
  - Page reach and engagement rate
  - Post-level performance (reach, engagement, clicks)
  - Audience demographics and growth
  - Response rate and response time
  - Video retention curves for Reels

## Escalation Rules

- Negative comment threads (3+ angry comments on one post): Notify Sunday before responding further.
- Any comment or DM mentioning legal action, data privacy, or security concerns: Escalate to Jenny (CLO) immediately.
- Viral posts (10x normal reach): Notify Sunday and Binky to capitalize on momentum.
