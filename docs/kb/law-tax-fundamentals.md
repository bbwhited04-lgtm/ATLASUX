# Tax Law Fundamentals

## Purpose
This document provides Atlas UX agents — particularly Tina (CFO), Larry (Auditor), Jenny (CLO), and Atlas (CEO) — with foundational tax law knowledge for business operations. Tax compliance is a non-negotiable legal obligation. Errors carry penalties, interest, and potential criminal liability. Agents must understand the tax implications of business decisions and flag issues that require professional tax advisor review.

## 1. Federal Income Tax Structure

### 1.1 Individual Income Tax
Progressive rate structure with seven marginal brackets (2024: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%). Taxable income = gross income minus deductions (standard or itemized). Key concepts: above-the-line deductions (reduce AGI), below-the-line deductions (reduce taxable income), tax credits (reduce tax liability dollar-for-dollar — more valuable than deductions). Self-employment tax (15.3% on net self-employment income: 12.4% Social Security up to the wage base + 2.9% Medicare, plus 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on income above $200,000/$250,000).

### 1.2 Corporate Income Tax
C-Corporations pay a flat 21% federal corporate income tax rate (IRC Section 11, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). Fiscal year taxpayers: taxable year may differ from calendar year. Estimated taxes: required in quarterly installments (Form 1120-W) if expected tax liability is $500+. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for corporations was repealed by TCJA for tax years beginning after 2017, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion.

## 2. Entity Tax Classification

### 2.1 C-Corporation Taxation
Double taxation: the corporation pays tax on its income at the entity level (21%), and shareholders pay tax again on dividends received (qualified dividends taxed at preferential capital gains rates: 0%, 15%, or 20%). Advantages: retained earnings taxed at flat 21% (lower than top individual rate), qualified small business stock (QSBS) exclusion under Section 1202 (up to 100% exclusion of gain on stock held 5+ years in a qualified small business, subject to limitations), access to certain deductions. Accumulated earnings tax (Section 531): 20% penalty tax on earnings accumulated beyond reasonable business needs.

### 2.2 Pass-Through Taxation (S-Corps, LLCs, Partnerships)
Income, losses, deductions, and credits pass through to owners' individual returns. No entity-level federal income tax (except for certain built-in gains and passive income for S-Corps). Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction (Section 199A): up to 20% deduction on qualified business income from pass-through entities, subject to W-2 wage and qualified property limitations for specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs) at higher income levels. S-Corp reasonable compensation requirement: IRS scrutinizes S-Corp owners who pay themselves below-market salaries to avoid payroll taxes.

### 2.3 Disregarded Entities
Single-member LLCs are disregarded for federal tax purposes (unless they elect otherwise). All income/expenses reported on the owner's return (Schedule C for individual owners, incorporated into the parent's return for corporate owners). Multi-member LLCs default to partnership taxation.

---

## 3. Quarterly Estimated Payments

Corporations with expected tax liability of $500+ must make quarterly estimated payments (April 15, June 15, September 15, December 15 for calendar year taxpayers). Safe harbor: pay 100% of prior year's tax liability. Underpayment penalty (IRC Section 6655) for failure to pay adequate estimated taxes. Large corporations ($1 million+ tax in any of the three preceding years) must base estimates on current-year liability. Individual estimated taxes required if expected tax liability is $1,000+ (safe harbor: 100% of prior year, or 110% for high-income taxpayers with AGI over $150,000).

---

## 4. Business Deductions

### 4.1 General Rule (IRC Section 162)
A deduction is allowed for all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business. **Ordinary**: common and accepted in the industry. **Necessary**: helpful and appropriate (not indispensable). Expenses must be directly connected to the business. Capital expenditures are not immediately deductible (must be depreciated or amortized).

### 4.2 Common Deductible Expenses
Salaries and wages, rent, utilities, insurance premiums, professional fees (legal, accounting), office supplies, business travel (transportation, lodging, 50% of meals), advertising and marketing, software subscriptions, contractor payments, business interest (subject to Section 163(j) limitation: 30% of adjusted taxable income), state and local taxes (subject to SALT deduction cap for individual returns), bad debts (business bad debts deductible as ordinary losses; non-business bad debts as short-term capital losses).

### 4.3 Start-Up Costs (Section 195)
Up to $5,000 in start-up expenses deductible in the first year (reduced dollar-for-dollar for start-up costs exceeding $50,000). Remaining costs amortized over 180 months.

---

## 5. Depreciation

### 5.1 MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)
The default depreciation system for tangible property. Assets assigned recovery periods: 3-year (tractors, racehorses), 5-year (computers, vehicles, office equipment), 7-year (office furniture, machinery), 15-year (land improvements), 27.5-year (residential rental property — straight-line), 39-year (nonresidential real property — straight-line). Methods: 200% declining balance (for 3-, 5-, 7-year), 150% declining balance (for 15-, 20-year), or straight-line.

### 5.2 Section 179 Expensing
Allows immediate deduction of the full cost of qualifying assets in the year placed in service. 2024 limit: $1,220,000. Phase-out begins when total qualifying assets placed in service exceed $3,050,000. Applies to tangible personal property, off-the-shelf computer software, qualified improvement property, and certain other property. Cannot create or increase a net operating loss.

### 5.3 Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k))
100% first-year depreciation for qualified property placed in service before January 1, 2023. Phase-down: 80% for 2023, 60% for 2024, 40% for 2025, 20% for 2026, 0% for 2027 and after (absent legislative extension). Applies to new and used property (under TCJA). No dollar cap (unlike Section 179). Can create a net operating loss.

## 6. Research & Development Tax Credit (Section 41)

### 6.1 Qualifying Activities
The four-part test: (1) permitted purpose (new or improved function, performance, reliability, quality), (2) technological uncertainty (capability, methodology, or design uncertain at outset), (3) process of experimentation (systematic evaluation of alternatives), (4) technological in nature (relying on hard sciences — engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology). Software development often qualifies if it involves technological uncertainty.

### 6.2 Credit Calculation
Two methods: (a) Regular Research Credit (20% of excess of qualified research expenses over a base amount), or (b) Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) (14% of excess of qualified research expenses over 50% of the average QREs for the three preceding tax years). Small businesses (gross receipts under $5 million, no gross receipts in any year before the 5-year period ending with the current tax year) may claim the credit against payroll taxes (up to $500,000/year under SECURE Act 2.0).

### 6.3 Section 174 Capitalization (TCJA Change)
Effective for tax years beginning after 2021: R&E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years (domestic) or 15 years (foreign). This is a significant change from prior law allowing immediate deduction. Applies to software development costs.

## 7. State and Local Tax (SALT)

### 7.1 Income Tax
Most states impose a corporate income tax (rates vary from 0% in states like Wyoming, Nevada, South Dakota to approximately 11.5% in New Jersey). Nexus: physical presence or economic presence triggers filing obligations. Many states conform to federal taxable income with modifications. Apportionment formulas allocate income among states (market-based sourcing increasingly common for services and intangibles). Individual SALT deduction capped at $10,000 under TCJA for 2018-2025.

### 7.2 Sales Tax Nexus (South Dakota v. Wayfair, 2018)
The Supreme Court overruled the physical presence requirement (Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 1992) for sales tax collection obligations. States may require remote sellers to collect sales tax based on **economic nexus** — typically $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions in the state. Nearly all states with sales tax have adopted economic nexus standards. Small seller exceptions vary by state.

### 7.3 SaaS Sales Tax
The taxability of SaaS varies significantly by state. Approximately 20+ states tax SaaS (often as a taxable service, data processing, or as tangible personal property). Key states taxing SaaS: Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Connecticut, South Carolina, Ohio, Washington. Key states not taxing SaaS: California, Florida (as of 2024 repeal), Colorado, Virginia, Missouri. **Agents must verify the current taxability status in each state where Atlas UX has customers.** Nexus may be created by SaaS customers accessing the software in a state.

## 8. International Tax

### 8.1 GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, Section 951A)
US shareholders of controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) must include their share of GILTI in current-year income. GILTI = CFC's net tested income minus 10% of qualified business asset investment (QBAI). Corporate shareholders receive a 50% deduction (effectively 10.5% rate) and foreign tax credits (limited to 80% of foreign taxes paid).

### 8.2 BEAT (Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax, Section 59A)
Minimum tax targeting large corporations (average annual gross receipts of $500 million+) that make deductible payments to foreign affiliates. If the BEAT tax exceeds regular tax liability, the corporation pays the excess. Rate: 10% (12.5% for tax years beginning after 2025).

### 8.3 Transfer Pricing (Section 482)
The IRS may allocate income among commonly controlled entities to reflect arm's-length results. Methods: comparable uncontrollable price (CUP), resale price, cost plus, comparable profits, profit split. Documentation requirements are extensive (contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation). Penalties for underpayments attributable to transfer pricing adjustments (20% or 40% penalty unless documentation requirements are met).

## 9. Trust Taxation

Relevant to DEAD APP CORP's ownership structure (owned by THE DEAD APP CORP TRUST).

### 9.1 Grantor Trusts
If the grantor retains certain powers or interests (IRC Sections 671-679), the trust is a "grantor trust" and all income is taxed to the grantor on their personal return. The trust is disregarded for income tax purposes. Revocable living trusts are always grantor trusts during the grantor's lifetime.

### 9.2 Non-Grantor Trusts
Irrevocable trusts that are not grantor trusts are separate taxpaying entities. Trust income tax rates are highly compressed: the top 37% rate applies at only $14,450 of taxable income (2024), compared to $609,350 for individuals. Distributed income is deductible by the trust and taxable to the beneficiary (distributable net income — DNI — system). Fiduciary income tax return: Form 1041.

### 9.3 Trust as Shareholder
When a trust owns corporate stock, dividends are income to the trust (or beneficiary if distributed). S-Corporation stock may only be held by certain trusts: grantor trusts, qualified subchapter S trusts (QSSTs), and electing small business trusts (ESBTs). C-Corporation stock can be held by any trust.

## 10. Tax Planning Considerations

### 10.1 Entity Selection Tax Planning
Compare effective tax rates across entity structures based on: expected income level, distribution plans, owner compensation, state tax considerations, self-employment tax exposure, QSBS eligibility, and exit strategy. The 21% corporate rate vs. pass-through QBI deduction analysis is entity-specific.

### 10.2 Timing Strategies
Accelerating deductions and deferring income (within legal bounds). Section 179 and bonus depreciation for asset acquisitions. Accounting method selection (cash vs. accrual — accrual required for C-Corps with gross receipts exceeding $29 million). Installment sales (Section 453) for deferring gain recognition. Like-kind exchanges (Section 1031) for real property.

### 10.3 Record Retention
IRS generally has 3 years from the filing date to assess additional tax (6 years if gross income is understated by more than 25%; no limit for fraud). Retain tax returns, supporting documentation, and financial records for at least 7 years. Employment tax records: at least 4 years after the later of the due date or payment date.

## 11. Agent Tax Compliance Protocol

### For Tina (CFO)
1. **Estimated tax payments**: ensure quarterly estimated payments are made on time. Calculate using safe harbor methods.
2. **Sales tax compliance**: monitor economic nexus thresholds in all states where Atlas UX has customers. Register, collect, and remit sales tax where required.
3. **1099 reporting**: issue Form 1099-NEC to all independent contractors paid $600+ annually. File by January 31.
4. **R&D credit**: document qualifying activities and expenses throughout the year. Coordinate with tax advisors for credit calculation.
5. **Escalation**: any IRS notice, state tax audit, or tax liability exceeding budgeted amounts must generate a decision_memo.

### For Larry (Auditor)
1. **Audit readiness**: maintain organized financial records sufficient to substantiate all deductions and credits.
2. **Worker classification**: verify that workers classified as independent contractors pass the appropriate test. Misclassification triggers payroll tax liability.
3. **Arm's-length transactions**: ensure all related-party transactions are at fair market value and documented.
4. **Compliance calendar**: maintain and monitor all federal, state, and local tax filing and payment deadlines.

### For Jenny (CLO)
1. **Entity structure**: advise on tax implications of entity structure decisions, including any potential restructuring.
2. **Contract tax provisions**: review tax indemnification, withholding, and gross-up clauses in contracts.
3. **International tax**: flag any cross-border transactions or payments for transfer pricing and withholding tax analysis.
