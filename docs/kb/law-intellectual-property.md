## 1. Patent Law

### 1.1 Patent Types
- **Utility patents**: protect new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter. 20-year term from filing date. The most common type (~90% of patents).
- **Design patents**: protect new, original, and ornamental designs for articles of manufacture. 15-year term from grant date (for applications filed after May 13, 2015).
- **Plant patents**: protect new varieties of asexually reproduced plants. 20-year term from filing.

### 1.2 Patentability Requirements (35 U.S.C. Sections 101-103)
- **Novelty (Section 102)**: the invention must not have been previously patented, described in a publication, in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date. The America Invents Act (AIA) moved the US from first-to-invent to first-inventor-to-file.
- **Non-obviousness (Section 103)**: the invention must not be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA) in light of prior art. Graham v. John Deere Co. (1966) established the four-part test: scope and content of prior art, differences between prior art and claimed invention, level of ordinary skill, and secondary considerations (commercial success, long-felt need, failure of others).
- **Utility (Section 101)**: the invention must have a specific, substantial, and credible utility.
- **Subject matter eligibility (Section 101)**: abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena are not patentable (Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, 2014). Software patents must demonstrate something "significantly more" than an abstract idea.

### 1.3 Patent Prosecution
Filing a patent application with the USPTO initiates prosecution. Provisional applications establish a priority date for 12 months at lower cost (no formal claims required). Non-provisional applications require: specification, claims, drawings, oath/declaration, filing fees. Average prosecution takes 2-3 years. Office actions require responses within 3-6 months (extendable for fees). Continuation, continuation-in-part, and divisional applications extend coverage.

### 1.4 Patent Infringement
Direct infringement (35 U.S.C. Section 271(a)): making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing the patented invention. Indirect infringement: inducement (271(b)) and contributory infringement (271(c)). Claim construction is the critical step (Markman v. Westview Instruments, 1996). Doctrine of equivalents extends infringement beyond literal claim scope. Defenses: invalidity, non-infringement, exhaustion, experimental use, prior user rights.

## 2. Trademark Law

### 2.1 The Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1051 et seq.)
Federal trademark law governing registration, protection, and enforcement of trademarks and service marks. A trademark is any word, name, symbol, device, or combination used to identify and distinguish goods/services and indicate their source.

### 2.2 Distinctiveness Spectrum (Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, 1976)
Marks are classified on a spectrum from strongest to weakest:
1. **Fanciful**: coined words with no prior meaning (e.g., XEROX, KODAK). Inherently distinctive; strongest protection.
2. **Arbitrary**: existing words used in unrelated contexts (e.g., APPLE for computers). Inherently distinctive.
3. **Suggestive**: suggest a quality or characteristic of the goods requiring imagination to connect (e.g., COPPERTONE for suntan lotion). Inherently distinctive.
4. **Descriptive**: directly describe a quality, characteristic, function, or feature of the goods (e.g., SHARP for televisions). Protectable only with acquired distinctiveness (secondary meaning).
5. **Generic**: common name for the goods/services (e.g., "computer" for computers). Never protectable. Genericide can strip protection from former marks (aspirin, escalator, thermos).

### 2.3 Registration Process
Application filed with the USPTO based on use in commerce (Section 1(a)) or intent to use (Section 1(b)). Examination by examining attorney. Publication for opposition (30-day window). Registration on the Principal Register (if distinctive) or Supplemental Register (if descriptive without secondary meaning). Maintenance: Section 8 affidavit (years 5-6), Section 9 renewal (every 10 years). Incontestability after 5 years of continuous use plus Section 15 affidavit.

### 2.4 Likelihood of Confusion (Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics, 1961)
The eight-factor test: (1) strength of plaintiff's mark, (2) similarity of marks, (3) proximity of products/services, (4) likelihood of bridging the gap, (5) actual confusion evidence, (6) defendant's good faith, (7) quality of defendant's product, (8) sophistication of buyers. Not all factors are weighed equally; the analysis is holistic.

### 2.5 Trade Dress
The overall commercial image or look and feel of a product (Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, 1992). Protectable if distinctive (inherently or by secondary meaning) and non-functional. Product design trade dress requires proof of secondary meaning (Wal-Mart Stores v. Samara Brothers, 2000).

## 3. Copyright Law

### 3.1 Foundations
Copyright protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression (17 U.S.C. Section 102). Categories: literary works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes/choreography, pictorial/graphic/sculptural works, motion pictures/audiovisual works, sound recordings, architectural works. Copyright does NOT protect ideas, procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries (Section 102(b); Baker v. Selden, 1879).

### 3.2 Rights of Copyright Owners (Section 106)
Exclusive rights to: reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform publicly, display publicly, and (for sound recordings) perform by digital audio transmission.

### 3.3 Registration and Duration
Registration is not required for copyright to exist (automatic upon fixation) but is required before filing an infringement suit and enables statutory damages and attorney's fees. Current duration: life of the author plus 70 years; for works made for hire, 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation. Registration through the Copyright Office (electronic filing preferred).

### 3.4 Fair Use (Section 107)
Four-factor balancing test: (1) purpose and character of the use (commercial vs. educational; transformative use is favored — Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 1994), (2) nature of the copyrighted work (factual vs. creative), (3) amount and substantiality of the portion used, (4) effect on the market for the original. No single factor is dispositive. Parody is a recognized fair use category. Google LLC v. Oracle America (2021) — API declarations are fair use in the software context.

### 3.5 DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)
**Safe harbor (Section 512)**: online service providers are shielded from liability for user-uploaded infringing content if they: (a) adopt and implement a repeat infringer policy, (b) accommodate standard technical measures, (c) designate a DMCA agent, (d) respond expeditiously to takedown notices, and (e) lack actual or red-flag knowledge of infringement. **Takedown process**: notice must identify the copyrighted work, infringing material, contact info, and include good-faith and accuracy statements. Counter-notice procedure allows restoration if no lawsuit filed within 10-14 business days. **Anti-circumvention (Section 1201)**: prohibits circumventing technological protection measures.

### 3.6 Work-for-Hire Doctrine (Section 101)
A work is "made for hire" if: (1) prepared by an employee within the scope of employment (using the agency law factors from Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 1989), or (2) specially ordered or commissioned and falling within one of nine enumerated categories AND the parties expressly agree in a signed writing. The employer/commissioning party is the author and initial copyright owner.

## 4. Trade Secrets

### 4.1 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA, 18 U.S.C. Section 1836)
Federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation, enacted 2016. A trade secret is information that: (a) derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable, and (b) is subject to reasonable measures to maintain its secrecy. Aligns with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) adopted in 48 states.

### 4.2 Reasonable Measures
Courts evaluate: NDAs/confidentiality agreements, access controls, encryption, marking documents as confidential, employee training, exit interviews, physical security, digital security measures. Failure to take reasonable measures destroys trade secret status. No bright-line rule — courts apply a totality-of-circumstances test.

### 4.3 NDA Enforcement
NDAs must be reasonable in scope (subject matter), duration, and geographic reach. Overly broad NDAs may be struck down or reformed. Consider mutual vs. unilateral NDAs. Include: definition of confidential information, obligations, exclusions (publicly available, independently developed, rightfully received), term, remedies, return/destruction obligations.

### 4.4 Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine
Some courts (PepsiCo v. Redmond, 1995) enjoin former employees from working for competitors when they inevitably would use trade secrets. This doctrine is controversial and rejected or limited in many jurisdictions.

## 5. AI-Generated Content and IP

### 5.1 Copyright Ownership
Under current US Copyright Office guidance (February 2023), AI-generated content without meaningful human authorship is not copyrightable (Thaler v. Perlmutter, 2023 — DABUS/Creativity Machine case). Works with substantial human creative input that use AI as a tool may be copyrightable for the human-authored elements. Registration should disclose AI involvement and claim copyright only over human-authored portions.

### 5.2 Patent Inventorship
Under current law, only natural persons can be named as inventors (Thaler v. Vidal, Fed. Cir. 2022). AI systems cannot be listed as inventors on patent applications. A human must have made an inventive contribution.

### 5.3 AI Training Data
The legality of using copyrighted works to train AI models is actively litigated (NYT v. OpenAI; Andersen v. Stability AI; Getty v. Stability AI). Fair use analysis is unsettled. Agents should flag any content generation that closely mimics specific copyrighted source material.

## 6. Benny's IP Protection Protocol for Atlas UX

1. **Brand monitoring**: regularly search for unauthorized uses of Atlas UX marks, logos, and trade dress. File UDRP complaints for infringing domain names.
2. **Trademark maintenance**: track all registration deadlines (Sections 8, 9, 15). Monitor the Official Gazette for confusingly similar marks during the opposition period.
3. **Copyright registration**: register all significant creative works (platform code, documentation, marketing materials). Maintain records establishing authorship and creation dates.
4. **Trade secret program**: ensure all proprietary algorithms, agent configurations, and business strategies are protected by NDAs, access controls, and confidentiality markings. Conduct periodic audits.
5. **AI content disclosure**: all AI-generated content published by Atlas UX agents must be identified as AI-generated where required by law or platform policy. Do not claim copyright over purely AI-generated outputs.
6. **IP clearance**: before adopting new product names, features, or designs, conduct trademark searches (USPTO TESS, common law). Before publishing content, assess fair use and potential infringement.
7. **Third-party IP respect**: agents must never reproduce substantial portions of copyrighted works without license or fair use justification. Agents must not use others' trademarks in ways suggesting endorsement or affiliation.
8. **Escalation**: any cease-and-desist letter received, potential infringement claim, or IP licensing opportunity over AUTO_SPEND_LIMIT_USD must generate a decision_memo for human review.
