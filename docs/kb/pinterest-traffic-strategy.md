## Purpose

This is Cornwall's operational guide for driving website traffic through Pinterest. Unlike other social platforms, Pinterest functions as a visual search engine. Content has a shelf life of months, not hours. A well-optimized pin posted today can drive traffic for 6-12 months. Cornwall's primary KPI is outbound clicks — not vanity metrics.

## SEO-Rich Pin Descriptions

Pinterest is a search engine. Descriptions are the primary ranking signal. Write every description like an SEO-optimized meta description:

- **Lead with keywords.** "AI business automation tools for small business owners" — not "Check out our latest post about AI!"
- **2-3 sentences, 150-300 characters.** Concise but keyword-dense.
- **Include a CTA:** "Click to learn how," "Read the full guide," "Get the free template."
- **Natural language over keyword stuffing.** Pinterest's algorithm penalizes obvious stuffing. Write for humans who happen to be searching.
- Use Pinterest Trends and the search bar autocomplete to identify exact keyword phrases your audience uses.

### Pin Title
- 40-60 characters. Descriptive and keyword-first.
- "2026 AI Automation Guide for SaaS Founders" — not "Our Latest Blog Post."
- The title appears in search results and feeds. Make it scannable and click-worthy.

## Board Organization

Boards are like website categories. Organize them intentionally:

- **10-15 boards** covering your core content topics.
- Each board should have a keyword-rich title and a 2-3 sentence description.
- **Minimum 10 pins per board** before the board becomes discoverable in search.
- Board ideas for Atlas UX:
  - AI Automation for Business
  - SaaS Productivity Tools
  - Workflow Automation Tips
  - AI Employee Platform
  - Small Business Technology
  - Future of Work
  - Business Operations Guides
  - AI Agent Use Cases
  - Digital Transformation
  - Startup Growth Hacks

- **Archive underperforming boards** (less than 50 impressions/month after 3 months). They dilute the account's topical authority.
- Pin relevant third-party content to boards too (20-30% curated content). This signals to Pinterest that the board is a genuine resource, not just self-promotion.

## Pin Design Standards

Pinterest is a visual platform. Poorly designed pins get scrolled past regardless of content quality.

### Dimensions
- **2:3 aspect ratio (1000x1500px)** is the standard. This fills the most space in the Pinterest grid without getting cropped.
- Square pins (1:1) work for some formats but take up less visual real estate.
- Never use landscape/horizontal pins. They get lost in the feed.

### Design Elements
- **Text overlay is mandatory.** 60% of Pinterest users discover new brands through pins with text overlay. The text should communicate the pin's value proposition in 5-8 words.
- **Brand colors and fonts:** Use a consistent visual identity. Cornwall's pins should be recognizable at a glance — consistent color palette, logo placement (bottom corner, small), and typography.
- **Readable at mobile scale:** 70% of Pinterest usage is mobile. If the text overlay is not readable on a phone screen, enlarge it.
- **High-quality images:** No pixelation, no stock photos that look generic. Custom graphics, branded templates, or high-quality product screenshots.
- **Face pins perform well:** Pins with human faces get 23% more engagement. Use team photos or lifestyle imagery when appropriate.

## Rich Pins Setup

Rich Pins automatically sync metadata from the website to Pinterest. They are mandatory:

- **Article Rich Pins:** Pull title, author, and description from blog posts. Increases credibility and click-through rate.
- **Product Rich Pins:** Show real-time pricing and availability. Essential if/when Atlas UX has direct purchasable products.
- Validate Rich Pins using the Pinterest Rich Pins Validator tool.
- Ensure the website has proper Open Graph and meta tags for Pinterest to pull.

## Seasonal Content Calendar

Pinterest users plan ahead. Content must be published **45 days before the relevant season or event**:

| Season/Event | Pin By | Content Ideas |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| New Year planning | Nov 15 | "AI tools to streamline your 2027 business plan" |
| Q1 business goals | Dec 1 | "Automate your Q1 workflow with AI agents" |
| Spring cleaning (business) | Feb 1 | "Declutter your business ops with automation" |
| Back to school/work | Jul 15 | "Set up your AI employee before September" |
| Black Friday/Cyber Monday | Oct 1 | "AI-powered deal management for small business" |
| Year-end reviews | Nov 1 | "How AI agents transformed businesses in 2026" |

Evergreen content (tutorials, guides, how-tos) should be published continuously. Seasonal content supplements the evergreen base.

## Pinterest Trends Tool

Use Pinterest Trends weekly to identify rising search terms:

- Navigate to trends.pinterest.com.
- Filter by your target audience demographics and region.
- Identify terms with upward momentum that intersect with Atlas UX's content areas.
- Create pins targeting these terms within 1-2 days of identifying the trend.
- Trending terms in our space to monitor: AI tools, business automation, productivity apps, SaaS solutions, workflow templates.

## Idea Pins vs Standard Pins

### Standard Pins
- Single image or video with a destination link. This is the traffic-driving workhorse.
- Every standard pin should link to a blog post, landing page, or product page.
- **80% of pins should be standard pins** focused on driving outbound clicks.

### Idea Pins
- Multi-page, story-like format. No outbound link (Pinterest removed link support for Idea Pins).
- Use for brand awareness, tutorials, and engagement — not traffic.
- **20% of pins should be Idea Pins** to boost account engagement metrics, which indirectly helps standard pin distribution.
- 5-10 pages per Idea Pin. Each page should have one clear idea with text overlay and visual.

## Click-Through Optimization

Since Cornwall's primary KPI is outbound clicks:

- **Tease, do not reveal.** The pin should promise value that requires clicking through to receive. "5 AI automation workflows that saved us 20 hours/week — see them all" is better than listing all five on the pin itself.
- **Strong CTA in the design:** Arrow icons, "Read More," "Get the Guide" buttons as part of the pin graphic.
- **Landing page match:** The page the pin links to must deliver exactly what the pin promises. Bait-and-switch kills trust and increases bounce rate, which Pinterest may track.
- **One pin, one topic, one link.** Do not try to cover multiple topics in a single pin.

---

## Posting Cadence

- **5-10 pins per day.** Pinterest rewards consistent, high-volume pinning more than any other platform.
- **Spread throughout the day.** Use a scheduling tool to distribute pins across morning, afternoon, and evening.
- **Mix:** 60% original content, 20% repins of high-performing content (your own older pins), 20% curated third-party content.
- **Best times:** 8:00-11:00 PM EST (peak Pinterest browsing), 2:00-4:00 PM EST, and 6:00-8:00 AM EST.

## Analytics Targets

Track weekly and report to Sunday every Monday:

|--------|--------|-------|
| Outbound clicks / week | 100+ | The primary KPI |
| Pin impressions / week | 10,000+ | Baseline for a growing account |

| Engagement rate | 1-3% | (Clicks + saves + closeups) / impressions |
| Top pin clicks / month | 50+ | Identify and replicate best performers |
| Monthly viewers | 5,000+ | Account-level vanity metric but useful for trend |

## Escalation Rules

- If a pin goes viral (10x normal impressions): Notify Sunday. Create 3-5 variations of the same pin to capitalize on the topic's momentum.
- If Pinterest flags or removes a pin: Do not repost. Review against Pinterest's content policies and notify Sunday.
- If outbound clicks drop 30% or more week-over-week: Audit pin designs, descriptions, and landing page performance. Report findings to Sunday.
