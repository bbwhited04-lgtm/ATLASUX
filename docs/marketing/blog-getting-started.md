# Getting Started with Atlas UX in 5 Minutes

*From zero to AI workforce in less time than it takes to make coffee. Here is your step-by-step guide.*

---

## Before You Start

You will need:
- An email address for your account
- Your business name and basic info
- Access credentials for any platforms you want to connect (Microsoft 365, social media, Stripe)

That is it. No technical setup, no server configuration, no developer required.

## Minute 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to **atlasux.com**
2. Click **Get Started**
3. Enter the access gate code (provided during onboarding)
4. You are in. Welcome to your dashboard.

The dashboard shows your AI workforce at a glance: active jobs, registered agents, completed tasks, and total spend. Right now, everything is at zero. That is about to change.

## Minute 2: Set Up Your Organization

1. Navigate to **Business Manager** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Business**
3. Enter your business name, industry, and description
4. Your tenant is created -- this is your isolated workspace where all your data lives

Every piece of data in Atlas UX is scoped to your organization. Multi-tenancy means your information is never mixed with anyone else's.

## Minute 3: Connect Your First Integration

Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**. Pick the one that matters most to you:

### Quick Win: Telegram (2 minutes)
1. Open Telegram on your phone
2. Search for your Atlas UX bot (provided during onboarding)
3. Send it a message: "Hello Atlas"
4. Back in the app, go to **Messaging Hub** > **Telegram**
5. Click **Set default** next to your chat
6. You now have two-way AI chat on your phone

### If you use Microsoft 365:
1. Enter your Azure AD credentials (Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret)
2. Atlas UX connects to your email, Teams, and calendar
3. Email automation is now ready

### Social media accounts:
1. Click **Connect** next to each platform
2. Complete the OAuth authorization
3. The corresponding social publisher agent activates automatically

## Minute 4: Upload Your Knowledge Base

This step makes your AI workforce sound like your business -- not a generic AI.

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Document**
3. Upload your most important files:
   - Brand guidelines or style guide
   - FAQ document
   - Product/service descriptions
   - Past content you are proud of (blog posts, emails, social posts)

Agents reference this material when creating content, responding to customers, and representing your brand. The more context you provide, the better the output.

**Pro tip**: Even a simple text file listing your brand voice ("professional but friendly, never use jargon, always lead with value") makes a measurable difference.

## Minute 5: Run Your First Job

Time to see your AI workforce in action.

### Option A: Chat with Atlas
1. Go to **Chat** in the sidebar
2. Select **Atlas** as your agent
3. Type: "Give me a summary of what you can do for my business"
4. Atlas responds with a personalized overview based on your Knowledge Base

### Option B: Run a Content Job
1. Go to **Job Runner** in the sidebar
2. Create a new job:
   - Type: CHAT
   - Agent: Reynolds
   - Message: "Write a blog post about [your industry topic]. Target audience: [your customers]. Tone: [your brand voice]."
3. Click **Run**
4. Watch the job move from queued to running to completed
5. Read the result -- a full blog post ready for review

### Option C: Trigger the Daily Brief
1. Go to **Agents Hub** > **Workflows**
2. Find **WF-010: Daily Executive Brief**
3. Click **Trigger**
4. Atlas compiles a briefing based on current data and sends it to your email

## What Happens Next

### Your First Week Checklist

- [ ] Review the Daily Brief email each morning (5 minutes)
- [ ] Approve or edit your first social media posts in the decision queue
- [ ] Upload 5-10 more documents to the Knowledge Base
- [ ] Try chatting with different agents (Binky for research, Cheryl for support scenarios)
- [ ] Check the Agent Watcher to see real-time agent activity
- [ ] Set up your budget preferences in Business Manager > Budgets

### Agent Activation Guide

Start with the agents that address your biggest pain point:

| Pain Point | Activate | First Task |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| No social media presence | Kelly, Fran, Link | "Draft 5 social posts about [topic]" |
| Blog is dead | Reynolds | "Write a 1500-word blog post about [topic]" |
| Support is slow | Cheryl | Upload FAQ, send a test support email |
| No financial tracking | Tina | Review the auto-generated ledger entries |
| Need market intel | Binky, Daily-Intel | Enable the daily intelligence sweep |
| Need leads | Mercer | "Identify 10 potential customers in [industry]" |

### Customize Your Automation

1. **Agent Watcher** (`/app/watcher`): Monitor everything agents do in real time
2. **Business Manager > Decisions**: Review and approve pending actions
3. **Settings**: Adjust auto-spend limits, daily action caps, and notification preferences
4. **Workflows**: Enable or disable scheduled workflows based on your needs

## Tips for the First 30 Days

### Week 1: Observe and Adjust
Let the agents work. Review their output. Adjust the Knowledge Base based on what they get right and wrong. This is calibration time.

### Week 2: Increase Autonomy
As you build confidence in the output quality, lower the approval threshold for routine content. Let auto-approval handle low-risk posts while you focus on strategic decisions.

### Week 3: Expand Coverage
Enable additional agents and workflows. If you started with social media, add blog publishing. If you started with support, add CRM tracking.

### Week 4: Measure Results
Compare your metrics (time spent, content output, response times, engagement) against your pre-Atlas UX baseline. The Business Manager > Intelligence tab shows everything in one view.

## Common First-Week Questions

**"How do I change an agent's tone?"**
Upload updated brand guidelines to the Knowledge Base. Agents reference KB content for every task.

**"What if I do not like a draft?"**
Reject it in the decision queue with feedback. The agent adapts. You can also edit directly before approving.

**"Can I use Atlas UX on my phone?"**
Yes. The Telegram integration gives you full agent access from your phone. The Expo React Native mobile app is also available for iOS and Android.

**"Is my data safe?"**
Every piece of data is isolated to your tenant. The audit trail logs every action. The Statutory Guardrail Layer prevents unauthorized actions. See the Security & Compliance tab in Business Manager.

**"What if I need help?"**
The Help page at `/app/help` has guided assistance. Cheryl can answer platform questions. You can also reach out through the Messaging Hub.

## You Are Ready

Your AI workforce is deployed. The daily brief will arrive tomorrow morning. Social publishers are standing by for content assignments. Cheryl is ready to handle support emails. Tina is tracking your finances.

Welcome to the future of business operations.
