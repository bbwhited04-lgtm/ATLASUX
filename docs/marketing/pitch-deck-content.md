# Pitch Deck Content

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Atlas UX is a full-stack AI employee platform that gives businesses an entire autonomous workforce -- not just a chatbot, but a governed team of 30+ AI agents with defined roles, approval workflows, and a complete audit trail. From CEO-level orchestration to social media publishing across 13 platforms, Atlas UX handles the work so business owners can focus on what matters.

## The Problem

Small and mid-size businesses face a hiring paradox:
- They need marketing, support, finance, legal, and operations capacity
- They cannot afford to hire specialists for each function
- Freelancers are inconsistent and expensive to manage
- Existing AI tools are fragmented: one for writing, one for social, one for email
- No tool offers governance, accountability, or audit trails

**The result**: Business owners work 70-hour weeks doing everything themselves, or they spend $15,000-$50,000/month on a team that still needs management.

## The Solution

Atlas UX deploys a structured AI workforce with:
- **30+ named agents** with defined roles (CEO, CRO, CFO, Legal, Support, 13 social publishers, media production, project management)
- **Chain-of-command governance** -- agents report to each other and ultimately to the human owner
- **Full audit trail** -- every action is logged, attributed, and reviewable
- **Safety guardrails** -- spend limits, action caps, approval workflows, and non-overridable statutory boundaries
- **Multi-platform automation** -- social media, email, blog, CRM, messaging, file management

## Team

Built by a solo founder with a vision for accountable AI that carries real operational weight. Atlas UX is not a weekend project -- it is a production-grade platform with enterprise-level governance built from day one.

## The Ask

- Seed funding to scale customer acquisition and agent capabilities
- Partnership opportunities with agencies and enterprise clients
- Strategic advisors with SaaS, AI, or SMB distribution experience

## Key Talking Points for Investors

1. **Not another chatbot**: Atlas UX is a governed workforce, not a text generator

3. **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Built for scale with full tenant isolation
4. **Recurring revenue**: Subscription model with strong unit economics

2. **Start in 5 minutes**: Connect your accounts, activate agents, and see results immediately
3. **No risk**: Low monthly cost compared to even one part-time employee
4. **Full control**: Approval workflows mean nothing happens without your consent
5. **Complete audit trail**: Know exactly what your AI team is doing at all times
6. **Scales with you**: Start on Starter, grow to Enterprise as your business grows
