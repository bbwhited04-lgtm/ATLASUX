## Atlas UX for Enterprise

Enterprise organizations need AI automation that does more than automate tasks — it must operate within complex governance frameworks, integrate with existing infrastructure, and meet stringent compliance requirements. Atlas UX Enterprise delivers autonomous AI agents with the security, control, and scalability that large organizations demand.

## Why Enterprise Organizations Choose Atlas UX

### Governance by Design
Most AI tools bolt on governance as an afterthought. Atlas UX was built from the ground up with the System Governance Language (SGL) — a formal DSL that enforces behavioral boundaries, spending limits, and approval requirements at every level of operation. This is not policy documentation that agents might follow; it is machine-enforced governance that agents cannot bypass.

### Structured Approval Workflows
Decision Memos provide a clear, auditable approval process for high-impact actions. Enterprise organizations can configure multi-level approval chains, delegate review authority by department, and set granular thresholds by action type and risk tier.

### Complete Audit Trail
Every action taken by every agent is recorded in an immutable audit log. The trail includes actor identity, action details, risk classification, timing, and outcome. This is not optional — it is architecturally mandatory.

### Tenant Isolation
Data isolation is absolute. Every database record is scoped to a tenant. There are no shared data tables, no cross-tenant queries, and no way for one organization's agents to access another's data. Isolation is enforced at the database, API, and storage layers simultaneously.
