# Use Case: E-Commerce

## How an E-Commerce Store Uses Atlas UX for Product Content and Email Campaigns

### The Challenge

ThreadLine is an online clothing store with 400 SKUs. The founder, Marcus, faces a content mountain:

- Each product needs descriptions for the website, social media, and marketplaces
- New arrivals need launch campaigns across email and social
- Seasonal promotions require coordinated content pushes
- Customer emails (order confirmations, shipping updates, abandoned cart recovery) need to be sent reliably
- Social media must showcase products daily to drive traffic
- Pinterest, Instagram, and TikTok are the highest-converting channels but demand constant visual content

Marcus tried hiring freelance copywriters ($2,000/month) and a social media manager ($3,500/month), but managing them took almost as much time as doing the work himself.

### The Solution

Marcus deploys Atlas UX Professional and configures his AI workforce for e-commerce operations.

### Setup

1. **Knowledge Base**: Upload product catalog (CSV with names, descriptions, materials, prices, size charts), brand voice guide, and past top-performing product descriptions
2. **Integrations**: Connect Stripe for transaction tracking, Microsoft 365 for email, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, Facebook, and X accounts
3. **Workflows**: Enable social publishing workflows, email automation, and daily intelligence sweep
4. **Templates**: Configure email templates for order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional campaigns

### Product Content Pipeline

**New Product Launch**

When Marcus adds a new product to his catalog:

1. He enters the product details in the Business Manager
2. Sunday (Communications) receives the brief and coordinates content creation
3. Reynolds drafts a blog post featuring the product (styling tips, material quality, brand story)
4. Venny generates product lifestyle images in the Atlas UX brand style
5. Social publishers create platform-specific content:
   - Cornwall: Pinterest pins with SEO-optimized descriptions
   - Timmy: TikTok caption for a product showcase video
   - Kelly: X thread with product highlights and purchase link
   - Fran: Facebook post with social proof angle
   - Link: LinkedIn post about the brand's sustainable sourcing
6. All content enters the approval queue
7. Marcus reviews and approves in one batch
8. Atlas publishes across all platforms over 48 hours (staggered for maximum reach)

### Email Campaign Automation

**Promotional Campaign Flow**

1. Binky identifies a revenue opportunity (e.g., seasonal sale, trending product category)
2. Sunday drafts the email campaign: subject line, body copy, CTAs, product highlights
3. Content is reviewed and approved via decision memo
4. Email is queued as an EMAIL_SEND job
5. Email worker sends via Microsoft Graph
6. Results are tracked: open rate, click-through, conversions
7. Tina logs the campaign spend and revenue attribution

**Automated Email Sequences**

| Email Type | Trigger | Agent |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Welcome series | New subscriber | Cheryl |
| Abandoned cart | Cart inactive 2 hours | Mercer |
| Post-purchase follow-up | Order delivered | Cheryl |
| Re-engagement | No activity 30 days | Mercer |
| Product review request | 7 days post-delivery | Cheryl |

### Social Media Strategy

**Platform-Specific Approach**

| Platform | Strategy | Content Type | Agent |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Pinterest | SEO-driven product discovery | Styled product pins, outfit boards | Cornwall |
| TikTok | Trend-aligned product showcases | Short-form video captions | Timmy |
| Instagram | Lifestyle and brand building | Story highlights, grid posts | Fran (via Facebook) |
| X | Community and flash sales | Threads, limited offers | Kelly |
| Facebook | Retargeting and community | Posts, event promotions | Fran |

**Daily Content Volume**
- 3-5 Pinterest pins (highest converting channel)
- 1-2 TikTok posts (aligned with trending sounds/formats)
- 1 Instagram post + stories
- 2-3 X posts
- 1 Facebook post
- 1 blog post per week

### Financial Tracking

Tina (CFO) monitors:
- Ad spend across platforms (Penny manages multi-platform ads)
- Cost per acquisition by channel
- Revenue attribution per campaign
- Inventory-related expenses
- Margin tracking per product category

The Budgets tab in Business Manager shows:
- Real-time spend vs. budget allocation
- Channel ROI comparison
- Period-over-period trends
