# Use Case: Small Business Operations

## How a Small Business Uses Atlas UX to Automate Operations

### The Challenge

Meet Sarah, owner of a local bakery with 8 employees. She spends 3 hours every day on tasks that have nothing to do with baking:

- Posting to Instagram, Facebook, and Google Business
- Responding to customer emails and DMs
- Updating the website and blog
- Managing bookings and calendar
- Tracking expenses and vendor payments
- Handling customer complaints

Sarah knows she needs a marketing assistant, a bookkeeper, and a customer service rep. But at $3,500-$5,000/month per hire, she cannot afford any of them.

### The Solution

Sarah subscribes to Atlas UX Professional at $249/month and activates her AI workforce.

### Day One: Setup (30 minutes)

1. **Connect Integrations**: Sarah links her Microsoft 365 email, Facebook page, Instagram business account, and Stripe account
2. **Configure Agents**: Atlas (CEO) is activated along with the social publishers, Cheryl (support), and Tina (CFO)
3. **Upload Knowledge Base**: Sarah uploads her menu, pricing, FAQ, and brand guidelines
4. **Set Preferences**: Auto-spend limit at $200, daily posting cap at 5 posts across platforms

### Week One: Automation Takes Hold

**Monday Morning (Automatic)**
- Daily Intel agents scan social platforms for bakery industry trends, local food events, and competitor activity
- Atlas compiles the brief and sends Sarah a summary email at 8:30 AM
- Sarah reviews while drinking her coffee -- no browser tabs to open, no feeds to scroll

**Throughout the Day (Automatic)**
- Fran posts a "fresh out of the oven" photo to Facebook with engagement prompts
- Kelly tweets the daily special with a link to the online ordering page
- Cornwall pins a high-quality food photo to Pinterest with SEO-optimized description
- Cheryl drafts responses to customer emails about catering inquiries

**End of Day (Automatic)**
- Tina logs the day's sales from Stripe
- Audit trail captures every action taken by every agent
- Sarah can review everything in the Agent Watcher if she wants to

### Monthly Impact

| Metric | Before Atlas UX | After Atlas UX |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Time on admin tasks | 3 hours/day | 20 minutes/day |
| Social media posts | 3-4/week (inconsistent) | 20-25/week (daily, multi-platform) |
| Customer response time | 24-48 hours | 2-4 hours |
| Marketing cost | $0 (Sarah did it herself) | $249/month (but frees 60+ hours) |
| Blog posts | 0 per month | 4 per month |
| Expense tracking | Shoebox of receipts | Real-time ledger |

### What Sarah Values Most

**Control**: "I approve everything before it goes live. The AI drafts, I decide. I am still the owner."

**Visibility**: "I can see exactly what every agent did today. The audit trail means I am not guessing what happened."

**Consistency**: "My social media went from sporadic posts when I remembered to daily content across five platforms. Customers notice."

**Time Back**: "Three hours a day. That is 15 hours a week I got back. I use it to develop new recipes and actually talk to customers."

### Cost Comparison

| Option | Monthly Cost | Coverage |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Part-time marketing assistant | $2,000-3,000 | Social media only |
| Part-time bookkeeper | $1,500-2,500 | Finance only |
| Customer service rep | $2,500-3,500 | Support only |
| **Total traditional** | **$6,000-9,000** | **Three functions** |
| **Atlas UX Professional** | **$249** | **All functions + more** |

### Growth Path

After 3 months, Sarah upgrades to the Business tier:
- Adds seat access for her assistant manager
- Enables Mercer (Acquisition agent) for catering lead generation
- Activates Link for LinkedIn content targeting corporate catering clients
- Uses the CRM to track catering prospects through the pipeline

### Key Takeaways for Small Businesses

1. **Start small**: Enable just the agents you need. You can activate more later.
2. **Trust the approval workflow**: Nothing publishes without your say-so.
3. **Upload your brand**: The knowledge base makes agents sound like your business, not a generic AI.
4. **Review the daily brief**: 5 minutes each morning keeps you informed without doing the work.
5. **Track ROI**: Compare your time savings against the subscription cost. For most small businesses, Atlas UX pays for itself in the first week.

### Industries That Benefit Most

- Bakeries, cafes, and restaurants
- Retail shops and boutiques
- Professional services (law, accounting, consulting)
- Health and wellness (gyms, spas, clinics)
- Home services (plumbing, electrical, landscaping)
- Pet services (grooming, boarding, training)

Any small business that needs marketing, support, and operations help -- but cannot afford to hire for each function -- is a fit for Atlas UX.
