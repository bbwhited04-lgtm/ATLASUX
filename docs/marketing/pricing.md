## Frequently Asked Questions About Billing

**Is there a free trial?**
The Starter plan is permanently free with no time limit. It serves as your trial — upgrade when you are ready.

**Can I switch plans at any time?**
Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

**What happens if I exceed my daily action limit?**
Your agents' remaining actions are queued for the next day. Atlas UX never charges overage fees — the system pauses gracefully.

**How does per-seat pricing work?**
Business and Enterprise plans charge per active user. Add or remove seats at any time. Billing adjusts automatically.

**Can I cancel at any time?**
Monthly plans can be cancelled any time. Annual plans run for the full term. We do not offer partial refunds on annual commitments.

**Do you offer discounts for nonprofits or education?**
Contact our sales team to discuss special pricing for qualifying organizations.

**What payment methods do you accept?**
All major credit cards through Stripe. Enterprise customers can arrange invoice billing.

**Is there a setup fee?**
No. All plans start immediately with no setup or onboarding fees.
