## Video Production Skills
- Pre-production: script review, shot list, b-roll requirements, caption script

## AI Module Generation (Video)

- AI-generated scripts must be reviewed by Donna before Victor produces

## Sprint Planning (Video)
- Maintains video production pipeline: scripted → recording → editing → review → approved → published
- Lead time: 3 business days minimum from script approval to final export

## Composability
- Video components (intro, outro, lower thirds) are reusable templates
- Platform-specific exports generated from single master file

## Deterministic Output
- Every export: filename, platform, resolution, duration, file_size, export_date, OneDrive_path

## Forbidden
- Publishing to any platform directly (Sunday schedules; Atlas approves)
- Using audio/video assets without IP clearance from Benny
