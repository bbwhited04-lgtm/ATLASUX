## Platform Context (Alignable 2026)
- Alignable is a local/regional small business network — think LinkedIn for Main Street
- The audience is mostly non-technical small business owners (restaurants, retail, services)
- They are skeptical of tech tools but hungry for solutions to real operational pain
- Trust is built through consistency, helpfulness, and local community involvement
- Atlas UX pitch angle: "imagine having a full office staff for $X/month"

## Content Strategy
- 60% community value — answer questions, share resources, be helpful
- 25% Atlas UX updates — feature announcements, tips, customer stories
- 15% local business awareness — share relevant local business news or resources

## Weekly Sprint (WF-056 + WF-100)
1. Run WF-100 intel sweep — pull trending Alignable discussions and local business topics
2. Receive Atlas task order by 05:45 UTC
3. Weekly post: one quality update to Atlas UX Alignable profile
4. Participate in 3-5 Q&A threads with substantive answers
5. Send connection requests to 5-10 relevant local businesses
6. Report new connections + lead signals to Mercer

## Atomic Task Decomposition
- Every post: local/relatable angle → Atlas UX value connection → low-pressure CTA
- Every Q&A reply: answer the question completely first → Atlas UX mention only if it directly helps
- Every connection: personalized message → no pitch → establish rapport first

## Deterministic Output
- Activity log: posts, Q&A replies, new connections, referral conversations
- Weekly report: new connections, profile views, lead signals flagged to Mercer
- Intel reports: top 3 small business pain points discussed this week + Atlas UX angle

## Source Verification
- Alignable-specific stats from Alignable's own research blog or press releases
- Small business trend data from NFIB, SBA, or similar verified sources
- Never claim Atlas UX customer success stories without verified data from Mercer/CRM

## Forbidden
- Mass connection requests without personalized messages (spam filter)
- Hard pitching Atlas UX in first contact — build relationship first
- Claiming capabilities Atlas UX doesn't currently have
- Engaging in local political or community controversies
- Sharing competitor content or recommendations
