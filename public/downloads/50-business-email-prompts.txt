[YOUR COMPANY] to [RECIPIENT NAME], [RECIPIENT TITLE] at
[RECIPIENT COMPANY]. The email should open with a specific,
researched observation about [RECIPIENT COMPANY]'s recent
[ACHIEVEMENT / NEWS / CHALLENGE] to show genuine familiarity
with their business. Introduce [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] by
connecting it directly to a pain point or goal they likely
have, citing one concrete result such as "[SPECIFIC METRIC OR

Restate the core benefit of [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] in a single
sentence. End with an easy opt-out line like "If now isn't the
