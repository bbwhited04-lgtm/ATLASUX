Their current cash position is [CASH ON HAND], average weekly revenue is approximately [WEEKLY REVENUE] (with seasonal variations in [MONTHS]), and their fixed weekly obligations total approximately [FIXED COSTS]. Create the forecast template with columns for each of the next 13 weeks and rows for: beginning cash balance, cash inflows (broken down by revenue stream, collections on AR, other income), total cash in, cash outflows (broken down by payroll, rent, vendor payments, loan payments, taxes, other), total cash out, net cash flow, and ending cash balance. Pre-populate with their estimates and flag any weeks where cash drops below a [MINIMUM CASH] safety threshold. Also include a section for "what-if" scenarios: what happens if revenue drops 20%, if a major customer pays 30 days late, or if they need to make an unplanned [AMOUNT] purchase.

Calculate: the break-even point in both dollars and units, the margin of safety based on their current revenue of [CURRENT REVENUE], how many additional [UNITS/CLIENTS/PROJECTS] they need to reach a profit target of [TARGET PROFIT], and what happens to the break-even point if they raise prices by [X]%, reduce variable costs by [Y]%, or add [AMOUNT] in new fixed costs (e.g., a new hire). Present this with clear formulas, a summary table, and a visual description of a break-even chart I can recreate for the client. Write a brief narrative explaining what these numbers mean for their business decisions.
