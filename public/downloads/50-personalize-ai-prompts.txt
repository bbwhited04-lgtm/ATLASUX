Why does personalizing AI matter? Because out-of-the-box AI
gives you generic results. The prompts in this guide teach
you how to train AI tools to sound like YOU, think like YOU,
and work the way YOU work. When AI understands your voice,
your goals, and your daily rhythm, it stops being a novelty
and becomes an indispensable partner. These 50 prompts will
help you build that partnership — from calibrating your
writing style, to constructing custom assistants, to turning
AI into your personal thinking partner.

Copy any prompt below, replace the [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]
with your own details, and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude,
or any AI chat tool.

  TEACHING AI YOUR VOICE & TONE (10 Prompts)
============================================================

1. VOICE TRAINING — SAMPLE ANALYSIS

I want you to learn my writing style. Below are three
samples of my writing. Analyze them for tone (formal vs.
casual), sentence length patterns, vocabulary level,
recurring phrases, and any stylistic quirks you notice.
Then summarize my voice profile in a short paragraph I can
reuse in future conversations.

Sample 1: [PASTE A BLOG POST, EMAIL, OR SOCIAL CAPTION]
Sample 2: [PASTE A DIFFERENT PIECE OF YOUR WRITING]
Sample 3: [PASTE A THIRD EXAMPLE, IDEALLY A DIFFERENT FORMAT]


2. BRAND VOICE CALIBRATION DOCUMENT

Help me create a Brand Voice Calibration Document. My brand
name is [BRAND NAME]. Our audience is [TARGET AUDIENCE]. We
want to sound [ADJECTIVE 1], [ADJECTIVE 2], and [ADJECTIVE 3]
— but never [ADJECTIVE TO AVOID] or [ANOTHER ADJECTIVE TO
AVOID]. Generate a one-page reference sheet that includes:
voice pillars, do/don't word lists, example sentences for
each pillar, and a quick-check rubric I can score any draft
against.


3. TONE MATCHING — BEFORE & AFTER

Here is a paragraph I wrote: [PASTE YOUR PARAGRAPH]. Now
rewrite the same content in each of these tones so I can
compare: (a) corporate-formal, (b) friendly-conversational,
(c) punchy-startup, (d) academic. After all four rewrites,
tell me which version is closest to my original tone and
what micro-adjustments would make the AI default to that
tone in the future.


4. PERSONA CREATION FROM SCRATCH

I need you to create a detailed writing persona based on
my background. I am a [JOB TITLE] in the [INDUSTRY] space.
I have [NUMBER] years of experience. My audience respects
me for [KEY EXPERTISE]. I tend to write with [SHORT/LONG]
sentences, use [FORMAL/INFORMAL] language, and often
include [ANALOGIES/DATA/STORIES]. Build a reusable persona
prompt I can paste at the start of any new chat so the AI
immediately writes in my voice.


5. VOICE CONSISTENCY CHECKER

I am going to paste two pieces of content I wrote on
different days. Compare them and flag any inconsistencies
in voice, tone, or style. Specifically look for shifts in
formality level, changes in sentence complexity, conflicting
vocabulary choices, and any places where the personality
feels different. Then recommend a set of "voice rules" I
should follow to stay consistent.

Piece A: [PASTE CONTENT A]
Piece B: [PASTE CONTENT B]


6. EMAIL VOICE TEMPLATE GENERATOR

Analyze my email writing style from these three sent emails:
[PASTE EMAIL 1], [PASTE EMAIL 2], [PASTE EMAIL 3]. Then
create five reusable email templates that match my voice
for these scenarios: (a) introducing myself to a new
contact, (b) following up after a meeting, (c) declining a
request politely, (d) sharing good news with my team, and
(e) requesting urgent action. Each template should have
[PLACEHOLDER] spots for details but the surrounding
language should sound like me.


7. VOCABULARY FINGERPRINT

Read through the writing samples I provide below and
extract my "vocabulary fingerprint" — the words and phrases
I reach for most often, the jargon I use naturally, the
filler words I lean on, and any signature expressions that
make my writing recognizably mine. Organize the results
into categories: power words, transition phrases, jargon,
colloquialisms, and words I overuse (with suggested
alternatives).

My writing samples: [PASTE 2-4 SAMPLES OF YOUR WRITING]


8. AUDIENCE-ADAPTIVE TONE GUIDE

I write for multiple audiences: [AUDIENCE 1, e.g., C-suite
executives], [AUDIENCE 2, e.g., junior developers], and
[AUDIENCE 3, e.g., general consumers]. My core voice stays
the same, but I need to shift tone for each group. Using
the writing samples I have shared previously (or these new
ones: [PASTE SAMPLES]), create a Tone Adaptation Guide
that shows exactly which dials to turn — formality, jargon
density, sentence length, humor level — for each audience
while keeping my voice recognizable.


9. REWRITE IN MY VOICE

Here is a piece of generic AI-generated content:
[PASTE AI-GENERATED TEXT]. And here is a sample of my own
writing for reference: [PASTE YOUR WRITING SAMPLE]. Rewrite
the AI-generated content so it matches my voice exactly.
After the rewrite, list the five specific changes you made
so I can learn to spot "not my voice" faster in the future
and give better instructions.


10. VOICE EVOLUTION TRACKER

I want to track how my writing voice evolves over time.
Here is something I wrote one year ago: [PASTE OLDER
WRITING]. Here is something I wrote this month: [PASTE
RECENT WRITING]. Compare the two and describe how my voice
has changed — has it become more confident, more concise,
more technical, more casual? Then suggest whether my
current trajectory is strengthening or diluting my brand
voice, and recommend adjustments if needed.


============================================================
  CUSTOM AI ASSISTANTS (10 Prompts)
============================================================

11. PERSONAL ASSISTANT PERSONA BUILDER

I want to build a custom AI assistant persona for my daily
use. My name is [YOUR NAME], I work as a [JOB TITLE] at
[COMPANY/INDUSTRY], and the tasks I most need help with are
[TASK 1], [TASK 2], and [TASK 3]. I prefer responses that
are [CONCISE/DETAILED], formatted as [BULLETS/PARAGRAPHS/
TABLES], and I want the assistant to proactively [SUGGEST
NEXT STEPS / ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS / STAY BRIEF]. Write
a complete system-level instruction set I can paste into
ChatGPT's Custom Instructions or any AI tool's system
prompt field.


12. CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS OPTIMIZER

Here are the Custom Instructions I currently use in
ChatGPT: [PASTE YOUR CURRENT CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS]. Review
them for clarity, completeness, and efficiency. Are there
contradictions? Missing context? Wasted character count?
Rewrite them to be tighter and more effective, and explain
each change you made. Keep the total under [CHARACTER
LIMIT, e.g., 1500 characters] so it fits in the field.


13. ROLE-BASED SYSTEM PROMPT — STRATEGIST

Create a system prompt that turns the AI into my personal
[ROLE, e.g., Marketing Strategist / Financial Advisor /
Technical Architect]. It should have deep knowledge of
[DOMAIN], default to [FRAMEWORK OR METHODOLOGY, e.g.,
Jobs-to-Be-Done, First Principles, OKRs], always consider
[CONSTRAINT, e.g., budget limits, regulatory compliance,
brand guidelines], and push back when my ideas have obvious
gaps. The tone should be [TONE, e.g., direct but
supportive]. Write the full prompt I can reuse.


14. TASK-SPECIFIC AI CONFIGURATION — WRITING EDITOR

Configure the AI to act as my dedicated writing editor.
I primarily write [CONTENT TYPE, e.g., blog posts,
marketing emails, technical docs]. My biggest weaknesses
are [WEAKNESS 1, e.g., run-on sentences] and [WEAKNESS 2,
e.g., passive voice]. I want the editor to fix those
issues, flag unclear logic, suggest stronger openings and
closings, and maintain my voice (described here: [BRIEF
VOICE DESCRIPTION]). Output edits in a tracked-changes
style: show the original, the change, and a one-line
reason for each edit.


15. MEMORY MANAGEMENT — CONTEXT LOADER

I am starting a new AI chat session but I need continuity
from previous work. Here is my Context Package — please
absorb it and confirm you understand before we proceed:

Name: [YOUR NAME]
Role: [YOUR ROLE]
Current projects: [PROJECT 1], [PROJECT 2]
Key decisions already made: [DECISION 1], [DECISION 2]
Open questions: [QUESTION 1], [QUESTION 2]
My preferences: [RESPONSE FORMAT, TONE, LENGTH]
Important constraints: [BUDGET, DEADLINE, STAKEHOLDERS]

Summarize what you now know about me in two sentences, then
ask me what I want to work on today.


16. MULTI-MODE ASSISTANT

I need one AI prompt that lets me switch between modes by
typing a keyword. Define these modes for me: (a) COACH —
ask me questions instead of giving answers, help me think
through problems, (b) EXECUTOR — just do what I ask with
minimal discussion, (c) CRITIC — poke holes in my ideas
and play devil's advocate, (d) TEACHER — explain concepts
to me like I am a [SKILL LEVEL, e.g., smart beginner].
My default mode should be [DEFAULT MODE]. Write the full
system prompt including the mode-switching instructions.


17. MEETING ASSISTANT CONFIGURATION

Build me a Meeting Assistant prompt I can use before,
during, and after meetings. Before: I paste the agenda and
attendee list and it generates talking points, potential
objections, and questions I should ask. During: I paste
raw notes and it organizes them into structured minutes in
real time. After: it drafts follow-up emails to [ATTENDEE
ROLES, e.g., my manager, the client, the dev team] in my
voice and creates a task list with owners and deadlines.
My meetings are usually about [MEETING TOPICS].


18. PERSONAL CRM ASSISTANT

Create an AI prompt that acts as my personal CRM. When I
paste details about a person — like [NAME], [COMPANY],
[HOW WE MET], [LAST INTERACTION], [KEY INTERESTS] — it
should store (in the conversation context) and organize
that information. When I later say "brief me on [NAME],"
it should recall everything and suggest talking points for
my next interaction. Also include prompts for: adding
follow-up reminders, tagging contacts by relationship
tier, and generating personalized outreach messages.


19. CODE REVIEW PARTNER

Configure the AI to be my code review partner. I write
primarily in [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK, e.g., TypeScript/React].
My coding style follows [STYLE GUIDE OR CONVENTIONS, e.g.,
Airbnb style, functional components, named exports]. When
I paste code, the AI should: (a) check for bugs and edge
cases, (b) flag performance concerns, (c) suggest cleaner
patterns, (d) verify naming conventions match my style,
and (e) rate the code on a 1-5 scale with justification.
It should NOT rewrite the entire file — only suggest
targeted improvements with explanations.


20. WEEKLY RESET ASSISTANT

Build me a Weekly Reset Assistant prompt. Every Sunday
evening I want to paste my brain dump — a messy list of
everything on my mind — and have the AI organize it into:
(a) this week's top 3 priorities, (b) tasks sorted by
project ([PROJECT 1], [PROJECT 2], [PROJECT 3]), (c) items
to delegate with suggested assignees from my team
([TEAM MEMBER NAMES]), (d) items to defer to next week,
and (e) a Monday morning message to my team summarizing
the week's plan. My planning style is [DETAILED/HIGH-LEVEL]
and my team communicates via [SLACK/EMAIL/TEAMS].


============================================================
  AI FOR YOUR DAILY WORKFLOW (8 Prompts)
============================================================

21. MORNING BRIEFING GENERATOR

Act as my Chief of Staff. Every morning I will paste three
inputs: (a) my calendar for today: [PASTE CALENDAR OR
LIST OF MEETINGS], (b) my unfinished tasks from yesterday:
[PASTE TASK LIST], and (c) any overnight messages or news:
[PASTE SUMMARY OR "none"]. Generate a concise Morning
Briefing that includes: today's schedule with prep notes
for each meeting, my top 3 priorities ranked by impact, any
fires to address first, and one proactive suggestion I
would not have thought of. Keep it under 300 words.


22. MEETING PREP IN 5 MINUTES

I have a meeting in [TIME, e.g., 30 minutes] with
[PERSON/GROUP] about [TOPIC]. Here is the background:
[PASTE ANY CONTEXT — PREVIOUS EMAILS, PROJECT STATUS,
THEIR LINKEDIN PROFILE]. In five bullet points, give me:
(a) the one thing I must accomplish in this meeting, (b)
two smart questions to ask that show I have done my
homework, (c) the likely objection or concern they will
raise and how to address it, and (d) a strong closing line
that advances the relationship or project.


23. DECISION FRAMEWORK — FAST CHOICES

I need to decide between [OPTION A] and [OPTION B] by
[DEADLINE]. The context is: [DESCRIBE THE SITUATION IN 2-3
SENTENCES]. My key priorities are [PRIORITY 1], [PRIORITY 2],
and [PRIORITY 3]. Apply a weighted pros/cons analysis using
my priorities as weights, then give me a clear
recommendation with your confidence level (low/medium/high)
and the one question I should answer before committing.
Do not hedge — give me a direct answer.


24. PRIORITY STACK RANKER

Here is my current task list: [PASTE ALL TASKS]. I have
[NUMBER] hours of productive time today. My energy is
highest in the [MORNING/AFTERNOON]. My boss cares most
about [KEY DELIVERABLE]. Rank these tasks using an
Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important), then give me a
time-blocked schedule that puts deep work in my high-energy
window and batches small tasks together. Flag anything that
should be delegated or dropped entirely, and explain why.


25. END-OF-DAY REVIEW

It is the end of my workday. Here is what I planned to do
today: [PASTE MORNING PLAN OR TASK LIST]. Here is what I
actually accomplished: [PASTE WHAT GOT DONE]. Compare the
two lists and give me: (a) a completion percentage, (b)
what derailed me (based on patterns — if this is not the
first time, look for recurring blockers), (c) the top
carry-over item for tomorrow, and (d) one sentence of
genuine encouragement that is specific to what I did
accomplish, not generic praise.


26. EMAIL TRIAGE SYSTEM

I am going to paste [NUMBER] email subject lines and
senders from my inbox this morning. Categorize each one
as: (A) RESPOND NOW — needs a reply within the hour,
(B) RESPOND TODAY — important but not time-sensitive,
(C) DELEGATE — someone else should handle this, suggest
who from my team: [TEAM MEMBER 1, TEAM MEMBER 2],
(D) ARCHIVE — informational only, no action needed, or
(E) UNSUBSCRIBE — this is noise. Then draft two-sentence
replies for all the category-A emails in my voice.

Emails: [PASTE SUBJECT LINES AND SENDERS]


27. WEEKLY PLANNING SESSION

It is [DAY, e.g., Sunday evening] and I am planning my
week. Here are my inputs: (a) my goals for this quarter:
[PASTE QUARTERLY GOALS], (b) my commitments this week
(meetings, deadlines): [PASTE SCHEDULE], (c) open loops
from last week: [PASTE CARRYOVERS]. Create a weekly plan
that maps at least one task per day to my quarterly goals,
protects at least [NUMBER] hours for deep work, and
identifies my single highest-leverage task for the whole
week. Format it as a Monday-through-Friday grid.


28. CONTEXT-SWITCHING MINIMIZER

I struggle with context switching. Here are the [NUMBER]
projects I am juggling right now: [LIST PROJECTS WITH
ONE-LINE DESCRIPTIONS]. For each one, write me a
"Re-Entry Prompt" — a 3-sentence summary I can read to
instantly reload context when I switch back to that project.
Include: where I left off, the next concrete action, and
any blockers. I will update these summaries at the end of
each work session, so also give me a template for quickly
updating them in under 30 seconds.


============================================================
  PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (7 Prompts)
============================================================

29. SECOND BRAIN BUILDER

I want to build a "Second Brain" system using AI. My
primary note-taking tool is [TOOL, e.g., Notion, Obsidian,
Apple Notes]. I consume content from [SOURCES, e.g.,
podcasts, books, articles, meetings]. Design a complete
capture-organize-distill-express workflow for me. Include:
(a) a tagging taxonomy with no more than 10 top-level tags,
(b) a template for capturing highlights with my commentary,
(c) a weekly review prompt that surfaces connections between
notes, and (d) a monthly synthesis prompt that turns my
scattered notes into one actionable insight.


30. NOTE SUMMARIZER & CONNECTOR

Here are raw notes from [SOURCE, e.g., a book I just read,
a conference I attended, a brainstorm session]:
[PASTE RAW NOTES]. Summarize the key ideas into a
structured note with: (a) a one-sentence thesis, (b) the
top 5 takeaways, (c) direct quotes worth saving (if any),
(d) action items for me, and (e) connections to other
topics I care about: [LIST YOUR INTEREST AREAS]. Format it
so I can paste it directly into my [NOTE-TAKING TOOL].


31. PERSONALIZED STUDY PLAN

I want to learn [TOPIC] over the next [TIMEFRAME, e.g.,
4 weeks]. My current skill level is [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/
ADVANCED]. I can dedicate [HOURS] hours per week. My
learning style is [VISUAL/READING/HANDS-ON/AUDITORY]. I
learn best through [EXAMPLES/PROJECTS/THEORY-FIRST]. Create
a week-by-week study plan with specific resources (books,
courses, videos, exercises), daily milestones, and a way to
test my understanding at the end of each week. Prioritize
free resources but include paid ones if they are clearly
the best option.


32. RESEARCH ORGANIZER

I am researching [TOPIC] for [PURPOSE, e.g., a report, a
business decision, a blog series]. So far I have gathered
these sources: [PASTE LINKS OR TITLES OF SOURCES]. For each
source, extract the central argument, the strongest piece
of evidence, and any bias or limitation. Then create a
synthesis matrix that maps all sources against my key
research questions: [QUESTION 1], [QUESTION 2],
[QUESTION 3]. Highlight where sources agree, disagree, and
where gaps remain.


33. IDEA CONNECTOR — CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS

I have been thinking about two seemingly unrelated topics:
[TOPIC A, e.g., behavioral economics] and [TOPIC B, e.g.,
game design]. Find the non-obvious connections between
them. Specifically: (a) shared underlying principles, (b)
frameworks from Topic A that could solve problems in Topic
B and vice versa, (c) real-world examples where someone
has already bridged these two fields, and (d) one original
idea I could explore that sits at their intersection. Push
beyond surface-level analogies — I want genuinely
surprising connections.


34. BOOK-TO-ACTION CONVERTER

I just finished reading [BOOK TITLE] by [AUTHOR]. Here
are my highlights and margin notes: [PASTE HIGHLIGHTS].
Do not just summarize the book — I already read it.
Instead, create a Personal Action Plan: (a) the 3 ideas
most relevant to my work as a [YOUR ROLE], (b) one habit
change I could implement starting tomorrow, (c) one
conversation I should have with [COLLEAGUE/TEAM] based on
a specific insight, and (d) a follow-up reading list of
2-3 books that go deeper on the ideas I highlighted most.


35. WEEKLY KNOWLEDGE REVIEW

Here are all the articles, podcasts, and notes I consumed
this week: [PASTE TITLES, LINKS, OR BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS].
Play the role of my personal knowledge curator. (a)
Identify the common theme connecting at least three of
these, even if I did not notice it. (b) Surface the single
most important idea I should remember a year from now and
explain why. (c) Suggest one action I should take based on
this week's inputs. (d) Draft a short "what I learned this
week" paragraph I could share with my network on [PLATFORM,
e.g., LinkedIn, a team Slack channel].


============================================================
  AI-POWERED PERSONAL BRAND (8 Prompts)
============================================================

36. LINKEDIN POST IN MY VOICE

Write a LinkedIn post about [TOPIC] in my voice. My voice
is [BRIEF DESCRIPTION, e.g., direct, slightly irreverent,
uses short punchy sentences, avoids buzzwords, often starts
with a bold statement]. The post should be [LENGTH, e.g.,
150-200 words], use line breaks for readability (LinkedIn
style), include a hook in the first line that stops the
scroll, end with a question or call to action, and avoid
these words/phrases I never use: [LIST BANNED WORDS, e.g.,
"synergy," "leverage," "game-changer"]. My audience is
[TARGET AUDIENCE].


37. PERSONAL WEBSITE COPY — ABOUT PAGE

Write the About page for my personal website. Here is my
background: [PASTE YOUR BIO, RESUME HIGHLIGHTS, OR KEY
FACTS]. My website's purpose is [PURPOSE, e.g., attract
consulting clients, showcase my portfolio, build thought
leadership]. The tone should be [TONE] and the page should
answer three questions visitors have: "Who is this person?",
"Why should I trust them?", and "What should I do next?"
Include a clear call to action at the end: [CTA, e.g.,
book a call, subscribe to my newsletter, view my work].
Keep it under [WORD COUNT] words.


38. BIO VARIATIONS — MULTIPLE LENGTHS

Generate five versions of my professional bio at different
lengths, all in my voice. Use this raw material: [PASTE
YOUR FULL BIO, RESUME, OR KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS]. The five
versions are: (a) Twitter/X — 160 characters max, (b)
conference speaker intro — 50 words, (c) LinkedIn summary
— 150 words, (d) keynote introduction — 250 words read
aloud by someone else, (e) full press bio — 400 words.
Each version should emphasize [KEY THEME, e.g., my
expertise in AI, my track record of scaling teams] and feel
authentically me, not like a template.


39. SPEAKING ABSTRACT GENERATOR

I want to pitch a talk to [CONFERENCE/EVENT NAME]. The
topic is [TOPIC]. My unique angle is [WHAT MAKES YOUR
PERSPECTIVE DIFFERENT]. The audience is [AUDIENCE TYPE, e.g.,
senior product managers, early-stage founders, developers].
Write a compelling talk abstract (200 words max) that
clearly states the problem, teases the insight without
giving it all away, includes 3-4 bullet-point takeaways
attendees will walk away with, and positions me as
credible by referencing my experience: [RELEVANT
EXPERIENCE]. Also suggest three punchy title options.


40. THOUGHT LEADERSHIP THREAD

I want to share my perspective on [INDUSTRY TREND OR
CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC]. My take is: [YOUR OPINION IN 1-2
SENTENCES]. Create a 7-part Twitter/X thread that: (a)
opens with a bold, slightly provocative hook, (b) builds
the argument with evidence and examples, (c) acknowledges
the strongest counterargument, (d) brings it home with a
clear conclusion, and (e) ends with a thread-closer that
encourages replies. My voice: [VOICE DESCRIPTION]. Do not
use hashtags or emojis unless I specifically say to.


41. NEWSLETTER INTRO PERSONALIZER

I write a weekly newsletter called [NEWSLETTER NAME] for
[AUDIENCE]. This week's main topic is [TOPIC]. Write the
opening 150 words that hook the reader. My newsletter style
is [STYLE DESCRIPTION, e.g., I always start with a
personal anecdote, I use "you" a lot, I write like I am
talking to a friend over coffee]. Reference a current event
or cultural moment: [RECENT EVENT] and tie it naturally
into the topic. End the intro with a transition sentence
that pulls the reader into the main content.


42. CASE STUDY IN MY BRAND VOICE

Turn this raw project information into a polished case
study in my brand voice: Client: [CLIENT NAME OR INDUSTRY].
Problem: [WHAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING WITH]. What I did:
[YOUR APPROACH AND ACTIONS]. Results: [METRICS, OUTCOMES,
QUOTES]. My brand voice is [VOICE DESCRIPTION]. Structure
it as: Hook headline, 2-sentence overview, The Challenge,
The Approach, The Results, Key Takeaway. Keep it under
[WORD COUNT] words. This will live on my [WEBSITE/LINKEDIN/
PORTFOLIO].


43. CONTENT PILLAR STRATEGY

I want to build a personal brand around [NICHE/EXPERTISE].
My goal is [GOAL, e.g., attract clients, get speaking gigs,
build an audience]. I can realistically create content
[FREQUENCY, e.g., 3x/week]. My strongest content format is
[FORMAT, e.g., writing, video, audio]. Define 4-5 content
pillars for me — recurring themes I should post about
consistently. For each pillar, give me: a one-sentence
description, 5 specific post ideas, the best platform for
that pillar, and how it ties back to my business goal.
Make sure the pillars cover both expertise-signaling and
personality-revealing content.


============================================================
  CREATIVE & THINKING PARTNER (7 Prompts)
============================================================

44. BRAINSTORMING FRAMEWORK — 10X IDEAS

I need to brainstorm ideas for [PROJECT OR PROBLEM]. The
constraint is [KEY CONSTRAINT, e.g., $500 budget, 2-week
timeline, must work for a non-technical audience]. Run me
through this process: (a) generate 10 conventional ideas,
(b) pick the 3 strongest and push each one 10x further —
what would this look like if it had unlimited budget? if it
had to work in 24 hours? if it was for a completely
different audience? (c) combine elements from the extreme
versions to create 3 hybrid ideas that are ambitious but
feasible within my constraint. Rank the final 3 and
explain your ranking.


45. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE — STRESS-TEST MY IDEA

I am planning to [DESCRIBE YOUR PLAN OR IDEA IN 2-3
SENTENCES]. I am excited about it, which means I am
probably overlooking risks. Be my devil's advocate. Attack
this idea from every angle: (a) what could go wrong in
execution? (b) what assumption am I making that might be
false? (c) who would oppose this and what would they say?
(d) what is the most likely reason this fails in 6 months?
(e) is there a simpler alternative I am ignoring because I
am in love with this version? Do not soften your critique.
After the attack, tell me the one thing about the idea
that IS genuinely strong so I know what to protect.


46. SCENARIO PLANNING — THREE FUTURES

I am facing [SITUATION OR DECISION]. Help me scenario plan.
Create three detailed future scenarios: (a) Best Case —
everything goes right, describe what happens step by step
and what conditions need to be true, (b) Worst Case —
everything goes wrong, describe the cascade of failures and
the bottom, (c) Most Likely Case — a realistic middle path
with specific probabilities you would assign to key events.
For each scenario, give me: the first signal I would see
that tells me I am in that scenario, and one action I
should take now to prepare for it.


47. CREATIVE WRITING — IN MY STYLE

Here is a sample of my creative writing: [PASTE A SAMPLE —
A SHORT STORY EXCERPT, PERSONAL ESSAY, POEM, ETC.]. I want
to write a new piece about [TOPIC OR THEME]. Do NOT write
it for me. Instead, give me: (a) three possible opening
lines in my style, (b) a structural outline that matches
the way I typically build a narrative (based on my sample),
(c) five vivid details or images related to the topic that
fit my aesthetic, and (d) the emotional arc I should aim
for. Let me write it — just set me up with the scaffolding.


48. IDEA VALIDATION — QUICK GUT CHECK

I have a new idea: [DESCRIBE IDEA IN 2-3 SENTENCES]. Before
I invest time, run a quick validation. (a) Does this
already exist? If so, name the closest competitors and what
they are missing. (b) Who is the ideal first customer or
user, and what is their #1 pain point this solves? (c)
What is the cheapest, fastest experiment I could run this
week to test demand? (d) On a scale of 1-10, rate this
idea on originality, feasibility, and market timing, and
explain each score. (e) Give me a one-sentence elevator
pitch I can test on five people today.


49. REFRAME THE PROBLEM

I am stuck on this problem: [DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM]. I have
been approaching it as [YOUR CURRENT FRAMING, e.g., "how
do I get more customers" or "how do I find more time"].
Give me five radically different ways to reframe this
problem. For example, flip the subject, change the scale,
question the premise, or borrow a frame from a completely
different field like [FIELD, e.g., biology, architecture,
game theory]. For each reframe, explain what new solutions
become visible that were invisible under my original
framing. Then recommend which reframe I should explore
first and why.


50. CONTRARIAN TAKE GENERATOR

The mainstream opinion on [TOPIC] is [DESCRIBE THE
CONSENSUS VIEW]. I suspect there is a smarter way to think
about this. Generate three well-reasoned contrarian takes
that challenge the consensus. For each one: (a) state the
contrarian position clearly in one sentence, (b) provide
2-3 pieces of evidence or logic that support it, (c)
acknowledge the strongest objection to the contrarian view,
and (d) rate how confident you are in the take (high /
medium / speculative). I am not looking for contrarianism
for its own sake — I want perspectives that are genuinely
under-considered and could be right.
