  50 Camera-Inspired AI Image Prompts

============================================================

Why camera-specific prompts? AI image generators are trained on
millions of real photographs — and those photographs carry EXIF
metadata, captions, and descriptions that reference specific
cameras, lenses, focal lengths, and lighting setups. When you
include "shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm f/1.2 at f/1.4" in your
prompt, the AI doesn't just read text — it activates the visual
patterns it learned from actual images taken with that exact gear.
The result is dramatically more photorealistic output: proper
depth of field, accurate bokeh, natural skin tones, and the
subtle optical character that separates a "generated image" from
something that looks like it came straight off a memory card.
These 50 prompts are engineered to exploit that connection.
Copy, paste, generate.
