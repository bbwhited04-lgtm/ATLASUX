  CODING & DEVELOPMENT (15 Prompts)
============================================================

31. I have a bug in my [LANGUAGE: JavaScript/Python/etc.] application where [DESCRIBE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR]. The relevant code is:

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

The expected behavior is [DESCRIBE EXPECTED BEHAVIOR], but instead it [DESCRIBE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR]. This started happening after [RECENT CHANGE/CONTEXT]. Walk me through a systematic debugging process: first, identify the most likely root causes ranked by probability, then suggest specific diagnostic steps (console.log placements, breakpoints, or test cases) to confirm the cause, and finally provide the corrected code with an explanation of why the original code failed. If there are multiple potential issues, address each one separately.

32. Perform a thorough code review of the following [LANGUAGE] code. Evaluate it across these dimensions: correctness (logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors), performance (time/space complexity, unnecessary iterations, memory leaks), security (injection vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication/authorization gaps), readability (naming conventions, code organization, comments), and maintainability (DRY violations, coupling, testability). For each issue found, rate its severity (critical/major/minor/suggestion), explain why it's a problem, and provide the refactored code. At the end, give an overall code quality score from 1-10 and list the top 3 improvements that would have the highest impact.

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

33. Design a RESTful API for a [APPLICATION TYPE: e-commerce platform/project management tool/social media app] with the following core resources: [RESOURCE 1], [RESOURCE 2], [RESOURCE 3].

Include authentication requirements per endpoint (public, authenticated, admin-only). Provide example curl commands for the 5 most important endpoints. Add rate limiting recommendations and versioning strategy (URL path vs. header). Format the entire specification in a way that could be converted to an OpenAPI/Swagger document.

34. Write optimized SQL queries for the following database operations in [DATABASE: PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite]. My schema includes these tables:

```
[PASTE YOUR SCHEMA OR DESCRIBE TABLES AND RELATIONSHIPS]
```

I need queries for: (A) [DESCRIBE QUERY 1 — e.g., "Get all orders from the last 30 days with customer details and total amount, sorted by amount descending"]. (B) [DESCRIBE QUERY 2]. (C) [DESCRIBE QUERY 3]. For each query, provide: the optimized SQL with comments explaining each section, the recommended indexes to support it (with CREATE INDEX statements), the estimated execution plan analysis, and an alternative approach if the table grows beyond 10 million rows. If any query could benefit from a Common Table Expression (CTE) or window function, show both the simple and advanced versions with performance trade-off notes.

35. Write a comprehensive regex pattern for [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU NEED TO MATCH — e.g., "validating international phone numbers," "extracting URLs from text," "parsing log file entries"]. The pattern must handle these cases: [CASE 1], [CASE 2], [CASE 3], and must NOT match: [NEGATIVE CASE 1], [NEGATIVE CASE 2]. Provide the regex in both [LANGUAGE 1: JavaScript] and [LANGUAGE 2: Python] syntax with any flavor-specific differences noted. Include: the raw pattern, a commented/annotated breakdown explaining each component, 10 test cases (7 that should match, 3 that should not), and a code snippet showing the regex in use with capture group extraction. If the pattern is complex, suggest a simpler alternative that covers 90% of cases and note what edge cases it misses.

36. Refactor the following [LANGUAGE] codebase from [CURRENT PATTERN/STRUCTURE] to [TARGET PATTERN/STRUCTURE: e.g., "monolithic functions to modular classes," "callbacks to async/await," "MVC to clean architecture"]. Here is the current code:

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Refactoring goals: improve testability, reduce coupling, and maintain backward compatibility with the existing API surface. Provide the refactored code in full, organized by file/module with clear file names. Include: a migration guide explaining each change and why it was made, a list of any breaking changes (aim for zero), new unit tests that validate the refactored behavior matches the original, and a checklist for QA to verify nothing regressed. Estimate the effort level (hours) and risk level (low/medium/high) for the refactoring.

37. Generate comprehensive documentation for the following [LANGUAGE] codebase/module. Include: (A) A README.md with project overview, prerequisites, installation steps, quick-start guide, and architecture diagram (in Mermaid syntax).

Use mocking/stubbing for external dependencies including [DEPENDENCY 1], [DEPENDENCY 2]. Include test data factories/fixtures for [DATA TYPES]. Aim for >90% code coverage and document any intentionally uncovered lines with justification. Organize tests using describe/context blocks and write descriptive test names following the pattern "should [EXPECTED BEHAVIOR] when [CONDITION]." Here is the code to test:

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Include: (A) An Entity-Relationship Diagram described in text (entities, attributes, relationships with cardinality). (B) Complete CREATE TABLE statements for [DATABASE: PostgreSQL/MySQL] with appropriate data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK), primary keys, and foreign keys with ON DELETE/UPDATE behaviors. (C) Indexes for the 10 most common query patterns. (D) A migration strategy for evolving the schema (include 2 example migration files for common changes like adding a column and creating a junction table). (E) Seed data SQL for development/testing (10-20 realistic records per table). (F) Performance considerations: partitioning strategy if any table exceeds 100M rows, and archival strategy for old data.

40. Build a complete [LANGUAGE] CLI tool that [DESCRIBE FUNCTIONALITY — e.g., "processes CSV files and generates summary reports," "manages local Docker containers," "automates Git workflow tasks"]. Requirements: accept arguments via [LIBRARY: argparse/commander/clap] with --help documentation, support both interactive mode and piped input, include colored terminal output for different message types (info, warning, error, success), implement proper error handling with user-friendly error messages and exit codes, support a configuration file (~/.toolnamerc in YAML/JSON format), and include a --verbose flag for debug output. Provide the complete source code organized into logical modules, a package.json/setup.py/Cargo.toml with dependencies, and installation instructions.

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Analyze the time and space complexity of the current implementation, identify all performance bottlenecks (not just the suspected one), and provide an optimized version. For each optimization, explain: what changed, the complexity improvement (e.g., O(n^2) to O(n log n)), the expected real-world speedup, and any trade-offs (memory usage, code complexity, readability). Include before/after benchmarking code that demonstrates the improvement. If applicable, suggest algorithmic alternatives (different data structures, caching strategies, parallel processing) and rate each by implementation effort vs. performance gain.

42. Create a complete authentication and authorization system for a [FRAMEWORK: Express/FastAPI/Rails/etc.] application. Include: (A) User registration with email verification flow.

44. Convert this [SOURCE LANGUAGE] code to [TARGET LANGUAGE], maintaining identical functionality while following the target language's idioms and best practices:

```
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Do not just transliterate — adapt the code to use [TARGET LANGUAGE]'s native patterns: appropriate data structures, error handling conventions (exceptions vs. Result types vs. error returns), concurrency primitives, and standard library utilities. Identify any functionality that does not have a direct equivalent in the target language and provide the closest idiomatic alternative with a note explaining the behavioral differences. Include: the complete converted code, a side-by-side comparison of key structural differences, any new dependencies required (with installation commands), and test cases that verify the converted code produces identical outputs to the original for the same inputs.

45. Create a CI/CD pipeline configuration for a [APPLICATION TYPE] project using [PLATFORM: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins/etc.].
