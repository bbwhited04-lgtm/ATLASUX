============================================================
  SECTION 1: EMAIL COPY TEMPLATES (10 Prompts)
============================================================

1. Sales Email — Cold Outreach Introduction

Write a cold outreach email from [YOUR COMPANY NAME] to a
[TARGET ROLE, e.g., VP of Marketing] at a [TARGET COMPANY
TYPE, e.g., mid-size SaaS company]. The email should open
with a specific, researched observation about their business
or industry — not a generic compliment. Introduce
[YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] by connecting it directly to a pain
point common in their role, such as [SPECIFIC PAIN POINT,
e.g., low email open rates or slow lead response times].
End with a soft, low-friction CTA like booking a 15-minute
call or replying with a single word. Keep the tone
conversational and peer-to-peer, not salesy. The entire
email should be under 150 words.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Sales Email — Warm Follow-Up After No Reply

Write a follow-up email to send 3 days after the initial
cold email received no reply. Reference the original email
briefly without guilt-tripping the recipient. Add one new
piece of value — either a relevant case study about how
[YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] helped a [SIMILAR COMPANY TYPE]
achieve [SPECIFIC RESULT, e.g., 40% increase in demo
bookings], a short industry stat, or a link to a useful
resource. Keep the tone helpful and human. The CTA should
be even softer than the first email — for example, "Would
it make sense to chat, or should I check back next quarter?"
Limit the email to 100 words maximum.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Cart Abandonment Recovery Email

Write a cart abandonment email for [YOUR BRAND NAME] that
goes out [TIME DELAY, e.g., 2 hours] after a customer
leaves [PRODUCT NAME] in their cart. Open with a friendly,
non-pushy subject line option (provide 3 subject line
variations). The body should remind them what they left
behind, emphasize one key benefit of the product such as
[KEY BENEFIT, e.g., "rated 4.9 stars by 2,000+ customers"],
and address the most common purchase hesitation for this
product category, which is [COMMON OBJECTION, e.g., "not
sure about sizing" or "waiting for a sale"]. Include a
clear CTA button text and optionally a small incentive
like [INCENTIVE, e.g., free shipping or 10% off]. Tone
should feel like a helpful nudge, not a desperate plea.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Product Launch Announcement Email

Write a product launch email announcing [NEW PRODUCT NAME]
from [YOUR BRAND]. The target audience is [AUDIENCE
DESCRIPTION, e.g., existing customers who purchased in the
last 6 months]. Structure the email as: (1) a bold opening
line that creates excitement or curiosity, (2) a 2-3
sentence explanation of what the product is and the core
problem it solves, (3) three bullet points highlighting
the top features or differentiators versus [COMPETITOR OR
PREVIOUS VERSION], (4) social proof if available such as
[EARLY REVIEW, BETA TESTER QUOTE, OR WAITLIST SIZE], and
(5) a primary CTA to [DESIRED ACTION, e.g., "Shop Now,"
"Join the Waitlist," or "Watch the Demo"]. Include a
subject line and preview text. Tone: [TONE, e.g.,
energetic, premium, playful].

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Re-Engagement Email for Inactive Subscribers

Write a re-engagement email for subscribers of [YOUR BRAND]
who have not opened an email in [TIME PERIOD, e.g., 90
days]. The subject line should create curiosity or a sense
of "we miss you" without being cliche. Acknowledge that
their inbox is crowded and you respect their time. Briefly
remind them why they signed up — what value [YOUR BRAND]
provides, such as [VALUE PROPOSITION, e.g., weekly
marketing tips, exclusive deals, or early access to new
products]. Offer one compelling reason to stay, like
[RE-ENGAGEMENT OFFER, e.g., a free resource, a discount
code, or access to a new feature]. End with two clear
options: a CTA to stay subscribed and a polite, guilt-free
unsubscribe link. Keep the email warm, honest, and under
120 words.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Upsell Email — Post-Purchase Recommendation

Write a post-purchase upsell email to send [TIME DELAY,
e.g., 5 days] after a customer buys [ORIGINAL PRODUCT].
Open by thanking them for their purchase and asking a brief
check-in question like "How are you liking [PRODUCT]?"
Then introduce [UPSELL PRODUCT] as the natural next step
or perfect complement. Explain specifically why these two
products work well together — for example, "[UPSELL
PRODUCT] pairs with [ORIGINAL PRODUCT] because [REASON,
e.g., it extends battery life, adds advanced features, or
completes the set]." Include a customer quote or review
snippet if available. Offer a [DISCOUNT OR BUNDLE DEAL,
e.g., 15% off when purchased within 7 days]. Tone should
feel like a helpful recommendation from a friend, not a
hard sell.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Newsletter Hook — Weekly Content Roundup

Write the opening section (first 3-4 paragraphs) of a
weekly newsletter for [YOUR BRAND/PUBLICATION NAME] that
covers [INDUSTRY OR TOPIC, e.g., digital marketing, AI
tools, ecommerce trends]. This week's theme is [THEME,
e.g., "Why your Q2 strategy needs a total rewrite"]. The
opening hook should be a bold, slightly provocative
statement or a surprising stat that makes the reader want
to keep scrolling. Transition into a brief overview of
what is covered in this issue — mention 3 topics:
[TOPIC 1], [TOPIC 2], and [TOPIC 3]. The tone should be
[TONE, e.g., witty and irreverent, authoritative but
approachable, or data-driven and concise]. End the intro
section with a teaser line that creates a curiosity gap
about the best piece of content below the fold.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. Seasonal Campaign Email — Holiday/Event Promotion

Write a seasonal promotion email for [YOUR BRAND] tied to
[HOLIDAY OR EVENT, e.g., Black Friday, Valentine's Day,
Back to School, New Year]. The offer is [OFFER DETAILS,
e.g., 30% off sitewide, buy-one-get-one, or free gift
with purchase over $50]. Open with a seasonal hook that
feels timely but not generic — avoid overused phrases like
"'Tis the season." Connect the holiday to your audience's
real life, such as [AUDIENCE CONTEXT, e.g., "You're
already juggling holiday shopping — let us handle the gift
ideas"]. Highlight [NUMBER] top products or categories
with one-line descriptions. Create urgency with a clear
deadline: [END DATE/TIME]. Provide 3 subject line options.
Include a primary CTA and a secondary CTA for customers
who want to browse more. Tone: [TONE, e.g., festive but
not cheesy, urgent but not desperate].

------------------------------------------------------------

9. Win-Back Sequence — Email 1 of 3

Write the first email in a 3-email win-back sequence for
[YOUR BRAND] targeting customers who purchased [PRODUCT
CATEGORY] [TIME PERIOD, e.g., 6-12 months ago] but have
not returned. This first email should NOT lead with a
discount. Instead, open with a genuine "here's what you
missed" angle — highlight [NUMBER] new products, features,
or improvements since their last purchase, such as
[NEW ADDITION 1], [NEW ADDITION 2], and [NEW ADDITION 3].
Frame the brand as having evolved based on customer
feedback. Use a conversational tone as if writing to
someone you have not seen in a while. The CTA should
invite them to explore what is new — not to buy
immediately. Mention that a special offer is coming in
a future email to create anticipation. Keep it under
150 words.

------------------------------------------------------------

10. Referral Request Email

Write a referral request email from [YOUR BRAND] to
customers who have been active for [TIME PERIOD, e.g., 3+
months] or have made [NUMBER] purchases. Open by
celebrating their loyalty — reference a specific milestone
if possible, such as "You've been with us since [MONTH]"
or "You're one of our top [PERCENTAGE]% of customers."
Explain the referral program simply: when they share
[REFERRAL MECHANISM, e.g., a unique link or code] with
a friend, both the referrer and the friend receive
[REWARD, e.g., $10 off, a free month, or bonus points].
Make sharing easy by providing pre-written text they can
copy and send. Address the implicit awkwardness of asking
someone to refer — frame it as sharing something they
already love, not doing you a favor. Tone: appreciative,
casual, and confident.


============================================================
  SECTION 2: AD COPY & HEADLINES (10 Prompts)
============================================================

11. Facebook/Instagram Ad — Primary Text + Headline

Write Facebook and Instagram ad copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/
SERVICE] targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE, e.g., small business
owners aged 25-45 who struggle with social media
scheduling]. The ad objective is [OBJECTIVE, e.g.,
conversions, lead generation, or traffic]. Provide: (1)
three variations of primary text (the main body copy above
the image) — one short (1-2 sentences), one medium (3-4
sentences with a hook + benefit + CTA), and one long (5-6
sentences with storytelling or social proof), (2) three
headline options (under 40 characters each), and (3) two
description line options. Each variation should test a
different angle: [ANGLE 1, e.g., pain point agitation],
[ANGLE 2, e.g., aspirational outcome], and [ANGLE 3,
e.g., social proof or authority]. Include a clear CTA in
every variation.

------------------------------------------------------------

12. Google Ads — Responsive Search Ad Copy

Write Google Responsive Search Ad copy for the keyword
theme [PRIMARY KEYWORD, e.g., "project management
software"]. The product is [YOUR PRODUCT] and the unique
selling points are [USP 1], [USP 2], and [USP 3]. Provide:
(1) 15 headline options (each under 30 characters) that
mix keyword-rich headlines, benefit-driven headlines,
urgency headlines, and brand-name headlines, and (2) 4
description options (each under 90 characters) that
expand on the value proposition, include a CTA, and
mention any offers such as [OFFER, e.g., free trial, no
credit card required, or 30-day guarantee]. Ensure at
least 3 headlines can work in any combination without
reading awkwardly. Avoid trademarked competitor names.
Include at least 2 headlines with numbers or specific
data points.

------------------------------------------------------------

13. TikTok Ad Script — Short-Form Video (15-30 Seconds)

Write a TikTok ad script for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE, e.g., Gen Z college students
interested in budgeting]. Format the script with
timestamps and on-screen text directions. Structure:
[0-3s] — Hook that stops the scroll (use a bold claim,
a question, or a pattern interrupt related to [HOOK TOPIC,
e.g., "I saved $400 last month doing this one thing"]).
[3-12s] — Demonstrate or explain the product's core value
in a native, non-ad-like way. Show [SPECIFIC USE CASE].
[12-20s] — Address a common objection like [OBJECTION,
e.g., "it's too complicated" or "I don't have time"].
[20-30s] — CTA with urgency, such as [CTA, e.g., "Link
in bio — free for the first 1,000 users"]. Include notes
on recommended tone of voice (e.g., casual, creator-
style, faceless with text overlay). Provide 3 hook
variations to A/B test.

------------------------------------------------------------

14. Retargeting Ad Copy — Website Visitors Who Did Not Convert

Write retargeting ad copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
targeting people who visited [SPECIFIC PAGE, e.g., the
pricing page, a product page, or the checkout page] but
did not convert. The ad should acknowledge their previous
interest without being creepy — do NOT say "We noticed
you visited our site." Instead, lead with a new angle
they may not have considered, such as [NEW ANGLE, e.g.,
a customer success story, a recently added feature, or a
limited-time offer]. Provide 3 versions: (1) social-
proof-led — featuring a stat or testimonial like [PROOF
POINT], (2) objection-handling — addressing the #1 reason
people do not buy, which is [MAIN OBJECTION], and (3)
urgency/scarcity — tied to [SCARCITY ELEMENT, e.g., "Only
50 spots left" or "Price increases Friday"]. Each version
should have a headline, primary text, and CTA button text.

------------------------------------------------------------

15. A/B Test Variations — Split-Test Ad Copy Framework

Generate A/B test ad copy variations for [YOUR PRODUCT/
SERVICE]. The control version (Version A) uses this
messaging: "[EXISTING AD COPY OR ANGLE]." Create 4
challenger versions (B, C, D, E), each testing ONE
specific variable while keeping everything else constant.
Version B: Test a different emotional trigger — change
from [CURRENT EMOTION, e.g., fear of missing out] to
[NEW EMOTION, e.g., aspiration or curiosity]. Version C:
Test a different opening hook — lead with [NEW HOOK TYPE,
e.g., a question, a statistic, or a bold claim]. Version
D: Test a different CTA — change from [CURRENT CTA] to
[NEW CTA STYLE, e.g., soft ask, urgency-based, or value-
first]. Version E: Test a different proof element —
replace [CURRENT PROOF] with [NEW PROOF TYPE, e.g.,
specific numbers, a testimonial, or an authority
endorsement]. For each version, explain the hypothesis
being tested and what metric to watch.

------------------------------------------------------------

16. Urgency-Driven Ad — Flash Sale or Limited Offer

Write ad copy for a [DURATION, e.g., 48-hour] flash sale
on [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] for [YOUR BRAND]. The discount
is [OFFER, e.g., 40% off, $50 off, or buy 2 get 1 free].
The copy must create genuine urgency without being
manipulative or using false scarcity. Lead with the time
constraint front and center. Emphasize what the audience
stands to lose by waiting rather than what they gain by
buying — frame the savings as disappearing, not appearing.
Include: (1) a Facebook/Instagram version with primary
text + headline, (2) a Google Ads headline + description,
and (3) an email subject line + preview text. Each format
should feature a countdown element or specific end date/
time: [END DATE]. Reference [SOCIAL PROOF, e.g., "Join
12,000+ customers" or "Rated #1 by G2"] to reinforce that
the product is worth buying even at full price.

------------------------------------------------------------

17. Story-Based Ad — Narrative-Driven Copy

Write a story-based ad for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] that
follows a mini narrative arc. The protagonist is [CUSTOMER
PERSONA, e.g., a freelance designer named Sarah who was
losing clients because her invoicing was a mess]. Structure
the story as: (1) The "Before" — paint a vivid, relatable
picture of life with the problem [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION],
using specific sensory or emotional details, (2) The
"Discovery" — how they found [YOUR PRODUCT] (keep this
brief and natural, not a hard sell), (3) The "After" —
concrete, specific results they achieved, such as
[SPECIFIC RESULT, e.g., "tripled her client retention in
2 months"], and (4) The "Invitation" — a CTA that invites
the reader into the same transformation. Write this in
first person as if the customer is telling the story.
Keep the entire ad under 200 words. Provide versions for
Facebook (long-form) and Instagram Stories (3-slide
text overlay).

------------------------------------------------------------

18. Benefit-Focused Ad — Feature-to-Benefit Translation

Write benefit-focused ad copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE].
Here are the top [NUMBER] features: [FEATURE 1], [FEATURE
2], [FEATURE 3], [FEATURE 4], [FEATURE 5]. For each
feature, translate it into a customer-facing benefit using
the "So that..." framework — what does each feature allow
the customer to DO, FEEL, or AVOID? Then write 3 ad
versions: (1) a single-benefit-focused ad that goes deep
on the most compelling benefit with proof and a CTA, (2)
a multi-benefit listicle ad that stacks 3-4 benefits in
rapid-fire bullet format for skimmers, and (3) a "what
if" ad that opens with a hypothetical scenario — "What if
you could [TOP BENEFIT] without [MAIN SACRIFICE]?" Each
version should work as both a Facebook ad and a LinkedIn
sponsored post. Include headline and CTA for each.

------------------------------------------------------------

19. Social Proof Ad — Testimonial and Data-Driven

Write a social-proof-driven ad for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
using the following proof elements: [TESTIMONIAL OR QUOTE
FROM CUSTOMER], [KEY METRIC, e.g., "Used by 10,000+
teams"], and [THIRD-PARTY VALIDATION, e.g., "Featured in
TechCrunch" or "G2 Leader, Winter 2026"]. Create 3 ad
variations: (1) Testimonial-led — open with the customer
quote, then briefly explain the product and CTA, (2) Stat-
led — open with the most impressive number, create
curiosity about how it was achieved, then reveal the
product, and (3) Authority-led — open with the third-party
validation or award, use it as a credibility anchor, then
pitch. For each version, provide Facebook primary text,
headline, and description. The tone should feel authentic
and confident — avoid hype words like "revolutionary,"
"game-changing," or "best ever." Let the proof speak for
itself.

------------------------------------------------------------

20. Video Ad Script — 30-60 Second Explainer

Write a 30-60 second video ad script for [YOUR PRODUCT/
SERVICE] targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Format with
timestamps, voiceover text, and visual direction on
separate lines. Structure: [0-5s] HOOK — Open with a
visually striking moment and a provocative voiceover line
related to [CORE PROBLEM]. [5-15s] PROBLEM — Expand on
the problem with relatable scenarios your audience faces
daily, such as [SCENARIO 1] and [SCENARIO 2]. [15-30s]
SOLUTION — Introduce [YOUR PRODUCT] with a clear, jargon-
free explanation of what it does. Show [KEY SCREEN OR
PRODUCT SHOT]. [30-45s] PROOF — Include [SOCIAL PROOF
ELEMENT] and demonstrate a specific result like [RESULT].
[45-55s] CTA — Clear call to action: [CTA, e.g., "Start
your free trial at [URL]"]. [55-60s] LOGO + TAGLINE.
Provide 2 hook variations and note any b-roll or stock
footage suggestions for each scene.


============================================================
  SECTION 3: LANDING PAGE COPY (10 Prompts)
============================================================

21. Hero Section — Headline + Sub-Headline + CTA

Write the hero section copy for a landing page promoting
[YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. The target audience is [AUDIENCE
DESCRIPTION] and the primary goal is [GOAL, e.g., free
trial signups, demo requests, or purchases]. Provide 5
headline options using different frameworks: (1) outcome-
focused ("Get [RESULT] without [PAIN]"), (2) curiosity-
driven (create an information gap), (3) social-proof-
anchored ("Join [NUMBER] [AUDIENCE] who..."), (4) direct
and clear (state exactly what the product does), and (5)
contrarian or myth-busting ("Stop [COMMON BAD ADVICE].
Do this instead."). For each headline, write a matching
sub-headline (1-2 sentences) that expands on the promise
and reduces anxiety. Also provide 3 CTA button text
options — one action-oriented, one benefit-oriented, and
one low-commitment. Specify what should appear below the
CTA: [TRUST ELEMENT, e.g., "No credit card required"
or "Trusted by 5,000+ companies"].

------------------------------------------------------------

22. Sub-Headline & Supporting Copy — Below the Fold

Write the "below the fold" supporting copy section for a
landing page about [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. This section
appears directly after the hero and should answer the
visitor's immediate question: "What is this, and why
should I care?" Write a concise section (4-6 sentences)
that: (1) restates the core value proposition in different
words than the hero headline, (2) identifies the specific
audience — "Built for [AUDIENCE] who [SITUATION, e.g.,
are tired of juggling 5 different tools]," (3) names the
top 3 outcomes: [OUTCOME 1], [OUTCOME 2], [OUTCOME 3],
and (4) transitions smoothly into the feature section
below. The tone should be confident but not arrogant —
let the product's value do the heavy lifting. Avoid
filler phrases like "In today's fast-paced world." Every
sentence should earn its place on the page.

------------------------------------------------------------

23. Feature Section — Benefits Grid with Descriptions

Write copy for a feature/benefits section on a landing
page for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. The section should
showcase [NUMBER, e.g., 6] key features in a grid layout.
For each feature, provide: (1) a short, punchy feature
title (3-5 words), (2) a one-sentence benefit description
that focuses on what the user gains (not what the product
does), and (3) an optional icon suggestion (emoji or
icon name). The features to cover are: [FEATURE 1],
[FEATURE 2], [FEATURE 3], [FEATURE 4], [FEATURE 5],
[FEATURE 6]. Write a section headline that ties all
features together under one theme, such as "Everything
you need to [CORE OUTCOME]." Ensure the descriptions
avoid jargon — a non-technical person should immediately
understand the benefit. Vary the sentence structures
so the grid does not feel repetitive.

------------------------------------------------------------

24. Testimonial Section — Customer Quotes with Context

Write the testimonial section for a landing page about
[YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. Create a section headline that
frames the testimonials (e.g., "Don't take our word for
it" or "Here's what [AUDIENCE TYPE] are saying"). Then
write [NUMBER, e.g., 3] realistic, detailed testimonial
quotes from fictional customers. Each testimonial should:
(1) mention a specific result or outcome (not just "Great
product!"), (2) reference the customer's role and company
type — [PERSONA 1: ROLE at COMPANY TYPE], [PERSONA 2],
[PERSONA 3], (3) address a different benefit or use case
of the product, and (4) feel natural and human — include
casual language, a mild imperfection, or a "before and
after" comparison. Below the testimonials, suggest what
additional trust elements to include, such as company
logos, star ratings, or a link to a reviews page. If
real testimonials exist, note where to replace the
fictional ones.

------------------------------------------------------------

25. FAQ Section — Objection-Busting Q&A

Write an FAQ section for a landing page about [YOUR
PRODUCT/SERVICE] with [NUMBER, e.g., 8] questions and
answers. The questions should target the real objections
and hesitations your [TARGET AUDIENCE] has before buying,
not generic questions nobody actually asks. Organize
them by priority — put the deal-breaker objections first.
Must-include questions: "How is this different from
[MAIN COMPETITOR OR ALTERNATIVE]?", "What if [COMMON
FEAR, e.g., it does not work for my industry, I am not
technical, I need to cancel]?", "Is there a [FREE TRIAL/
MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE]?", and "How quickly will I see
results?" Each answer should be 2-4 sentences: direct,
honest, and confidence-building. Do not be defensive.
If there is a legitimate limitation, acknowledge it and
reframe it. End the FAQ section with a closing line like
"Still have questions? [CTA, e.g., Chat with us or email
support@domain.com]."

------------------------------------------------------------

26. Pricing Page Copy — Plan Descriptions and CTAs

Write copy for a pricing page for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
with [NUMBER, e.g., 3] pricing tiers: [TIER 1 NAME +
PRICE], [TIER 2 NAME + PRICE], [TIER 3 NAME + PRICE].
For each tier, provide: (1) a one-line positioning
statement (e.g., "Perfect for freelancers just starting
out"), (2) a bullet list of [NUMBER] included features
written as benefits (not just feature names), (3) a CTA
button text that matches the tier's commitment level
(e.g., "Start Free" vs. "Go Pro" vs. "Contact Sales"),
and (4) a "best for" description. Highlight the
recommended tier with a "Most Popular" badge and explain
why it is the best value. Write a pricing page headline
and a brief paragraph below it that frames pricing as
an investment, not a cost. Include a money-back guarantee
statement if applicable: [GUARANTEE DETAILS]. Add a
note about annual vs. monthly billing if relevant.

------------------------------------------------------------

27. Comparison Page — Your Product vs. Competitors

Write copy for a comparison page that positions [YOUR
PRODUCT] against [COMPETITOR 1] and [COMPETITOR 2]. The
page should feel fair and informative, not like a hit
piece. Structure: (1) Headline — frame the comparison as
helpful, e.g., "[YOUR PRODUCT] vs. [COMPETITOR]: Which
is right for you?" (2) Brief intro paragraph (3
sentences) acknowledging that all three are good products
but serve different needs. (3) A comparison table with
[NUMBER, e.g., 8] criteria: [CRITERIA LIST, e.g., pricing,
ease of use, integrations, customer support, scalability,
customization, mobile experience, onboarding time]. For
each row, write short descriptions (not just checkmarks)
that explain the nuance. (4) A "Choose [YOUR PRODUCT]
if..." summary section with 3-4 bullet points identifying
the ideal customer. (5) A "Choose [COMPETITOR] if..."
section for each competitor (be genuinely helpful). End
with a CTA to try your product with a low-risk offer.

------------------------------------------------------------

28. About Page Copy — Brand Story and Mission

Write the About page copy for [YOUR BRAND/COMPANY NAME].
The founders are [FOUNDER NAME(S) AND BRIEF BACKGROUND].
The company was started because [ORIGIN STORY, e.g., they
experienced the problem firsthand, they noticed a gap in
the market, or they were frustrated with existing
solutions]. Structure the page as: (1) Opening paragraph
— a compelling, human story about why the company exists
(not corporate speak), (2) Mission statement — one clear
sentence starting with "We believe..." or "Our mission
is...", (3) "What we do" section — 2-3 sentences
explaining the product in plain English, (4) Values or
principles — [NUMBER, e.g., 3] core values with a one-
sentence explanation each, and (5) Team section intro —
a brief paragraph about the team culture and what drives
the people behind the product. The tone should be
[TONE, e.g., authentic and scrappy, polished and
professional, or warm and community-driven]. Avoid
buzzwords like "synergy," "disrupt," and "leverage."

------------------------------------------------------------

29. CTA Sections — Multiple Conversion Points

Write copy for [NUMBER, e.g., 4] different CTA sections
to be placed throughout a landing page for [YOUR PRODUCT/
SERVICE]. Each CTA section should work independently
(visitors may scroll to any of them). Create: (1) Top-of-
page CTA (after hero) — high-energy, rides the momentum
of the headline. Headline + 1-line description + button
text. (2) Mid-page CTA (after features section) — more
rational, references what the visitor just learned.
Headline + 2-line description + button text. (3) Social-
proof CTA (after testimonials) — leverages the trust just
built. Headline + 1-line description + button text +
trust element below the button. (4) Bottom-of-page CTA
(final section) — creates a sense of "now or never"
without being pushy. Headline + 2-line description +
primary button text + secondary link text for visitors
who are not ready yet (e.g., "Not ready? Download our
free [RESOURCE] instead."). Vary the language across all
four so the page does not feel repetitive.

------------------------------------------------------------

30. Trust-Building Section — Logos, Badges, and Proof

Write copy for a trust-building section on a landing page
for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. This section should eliminate
risk and build credibility for skeptical visitors who have
scrolled past the features and testimonials but are still
not convinced. Include: (1) A section headline like "You
are in good company" or "Trusted by teams at..." with
placeholder spots for [NUMBER] company logos. (2) A
"by the numbers" mini-section with [NUMBER, e.g., 3-4]
impressive stats formatted as large numbers with labels,
such as [STAT 1, e.g., "10,000+ active users"], [STAT 2,
e.g., "99.9% uptime"], [STAT 3, e.g., "$2M+ saved by
customers"]. (3) Security and compliance badges —
reference any certifications like [CERTIFICATIONS, e.g.,
SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, SSL]. (4) Guarantee statement —
write a 2-sentence risk-reversal statement about [YOUR
GUARANTEE, e.g., 30-day money-back, free cancellation].
(5) A brief "As seen in" row if applicable with media
publication names. The tone should convey stability
and reliability.


============================================================
  SECTION 4: SOCIAL MEDIA COPY (10 Prompts)
============================================================

31. Carousel Post — Multi-Slide Educational Content

Write copy for a [NUMBER, e.g., 10]-slide Instagram or
LinkedIn carousel post about [TOPIC, e.g., "5 email
subject line formulas that actually work"]. For each
slide, provide: (1) the slide headline (large text, under
8 words), (2) the supporting body text (1-3 short
sentences), and (3) a design direction note (background
color, any icons or visuals to include). Slide 1 should
be the cover — a bold, curiosity-driving title that makes
people swipe. Slides 2 through [N-1] should each cover
one key point with an actionable tip or example. The
final slide should be a CTA — [CTA, e.g., "Follow for
more marketing tips," "Save this for later," or "DM us
'GUIDE' for the full playbook"]. Also write the caption
that accompanies the carousel: a hook (first line visible
before "...more"), a brief expansion, and 3-5 relevant
hashtags. The caption should complement, not repeat, the
carousel content.

32. Twitter/X Thread — Hook + Value + CTA

Write a Twitter/X thread with [NUMBER, e.g., 8-10] tweets
about [TOPIC, e.g., "How I grew my newsletter from 0 to
10,000 subscribers in 6 months"]. Tweet 1 (the hook)
should stop the scroll — use a bold claim, a surprising
result, or a contrarian take. Tweets 2 through [N-1]
should each deliver one distinct insight, tip, or lesson.
Use short paragraphs, line breaks for readability, and
specific examples or numbers wherever possible. Avoid
generic advice — each tweet should pass the "so what?"
test. Include at least one tweet with a personal story or
mistake learned from. The second-to-last tweet should
summarize the key takeaway in one powerful sentence. The
final tweet should include a CTA: [CTA, e.g., "Follow me
for more threads like this," "RT the first tweet if this
was helpful," or "Grab my free [RESOURCE] at [LINK]"].
Write an alt-text suggestion for any tweet that would
benefit from an image.

------------------------------------------------------------

33. LinkedIn Post — Thought Leadership

Write a LinkedIn post from [YOUR NAME/ROLE] about [TOPIC,
e.g., a leadership lesson, industry trend, or career
insight]. The post should position the author as a
thoughtful expert without being preachy or self-
promotional. Structure: (1) Hook — the first 1-2 lines
(visible before "...see more") must be compelling enough
to earn the click. Use a surprising statement, a
counterintuitive insight, or a vulnerable admission.
(2) Body — 6-10 short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each)
that tell a story or build an argument. Use line breaks
heavily — LinkedIn rewards white space. Include a specific
example from [YOUR EXPERIENCE OR INDUSTRY]. (3) Takeaway
— one clear, actionable lesson the reader can apply today.
(4) Engagement driver — end with a question that invites
comments, such as [QUESTION, e.g., "What is the most
counterintuitive lesson you have learned in your
career?"]. Avoid hashtag spam — use 3 targeted hashtags
maximum. Do not use corporate buzzwords.

------------------------------------------------------------

34. Instagram Caption — Product Showcase

Write an Instagram caption for a post showcasing [PRODUCT
NAME] from [YOUR BRAND]. The image/video shows [IMAGE
DESCRIPTION, e.g., flat-lay product photography, a
customer using the product, or a before-and-after]. The
caption should: (1) open with a hook that is NOT about
the product — start with the customer's problem, desire,
or emotion, such as [HOOK ANGLE, e.g., "That feeling when
your skincare finally just... works"]. (2) Transition into
the product naturally — explain what it is and why it
matters in 2-3 sentences. Highlight [KEY BENEFIT] and
[UNIQUE FEATURE]. (3) Include social proof if available:
[SOCIAL PROOF, e.g., "5,000+ five-star reviews" or "Sold
out twice — back in stock now"]. (4) End with a CTA:
[CTA, e.g., "Tap the link in bio to shop," "Drop a [EMOJI]
if you need this," or "Tag someone who needs to try
this"]. Write 2 caption versions — one short (under 100
words for feed scrollers) and one long (200+ words for
the explore page algorithm). Include 15-20 hashtag
suggestions grouped by type: branded, product, niche,
community.

------------------------------------------------------------

35. Pinterest Pin Description — SEO-Optimized

Write a Pinterest pin description for [CONTENT TYPE, e.g.,
a blog post, product listing, recipe, or infographic]
about [TOPIC]. The pin image shows [IMAGE DESCRIPTION].
Pinterest descriptions function as both user-facing copy
and SEO — they must be keyword-rich while still reading
naturally. Structure: (1) Opening line — a benefit-driven
statement that tells the pinner exactly what they will get,
such as "Learn [OUTCOME] with this step-by-step [CONTENT
TYPE]." (2) Middle — 2-3 sentences expanding on the value,
including keywords: [KEYWORD 1], [KEYWORD 2], [KEYWORD 3],
[KEYWORD 4]. Mention specific details that make this pin
worth saving: [SPECIFIC DETAIL, e.g., "includes printable
template," "with before-and-after photos," or "real
budget numbers included"]. (3) CTA — invite the click,
such as "Click through for the full guide" or "Save this
pin for later!" Keep the total description between 100-200
words. Also provide: a pin title (under 100 characters)
and 3 board name suggestions where this pin would perform
well.

------------------------------------------------------------

36. TikTok Caption — Short, Punchy, Algorithm-Friendly

Write a TikTok caption and on-screen text overlay copy for
a video about [TOPIC/CONTENT, e.g., "3 ChatGPT prompts
for writing emails faster"]. The video style is [STYLE,
e.g., talking head, screen recording, trending audio with
text overlay, or green screen]. Provide: (1) The caption
(under 150 characters) — it should be a hook, a bold
claim, or a question that creates a "wait, what?" reaction.
Include 3-5 relevant hashtags and one trending hashtag if
applicable. (2) On-screen text for each section of the
video: [SECTION 1: HOOK TEXT, 3-5 words], [SECTION 2:
MAIN POINT, 5-8 words], [SECTION 3: PAYOFF OR CTA, 3-5
words]. (3) A pinned comment suggestion that drives
engagement, such as a question, a hot take, or "Comment
[WORD] and I will send you the [FREE RESOURCE]." (4) 3
alternative caption variations for reposting or A/B
testing. The tone should match TikTok's native voice:
casual, direct, slightly chaotic, and authentic.

------------------------------------------------------------

37. Community Engagement Post — Spark Discussion

Write a social media post for [PLATFORM, e.g., Facebook
Group, Reddit, Discord, or LinkedIn] designed to spark
genuine discussion among [YOUR COMMUNITY/AUDIENCE, e.g.,
freelance designers, startup founders, or fitness coaches].
The topic is [TOPIC, e.g., pricing strategies, favorite
tools, unpopular opinions, or lessons learned]. The post
should NOT feel like a brand posting — it should feel
like a peer starting a conversation. Structure: (1) A
personal or vulnerable opening statement that establishes
credibility and relatability, such as [OPENING, e.g., "I
have been freelancing for 5 years and I still second-guess
my pricing every time"]. (2) A clear, specific question
that is easy to answer — not "What do you think about
X?" but rather "What is the ONE tool you could not run
your business without, and why?" (3) Your own answer to
the question (leading by example encourages responses).
(4) A closing line that encourages diverse perspectives:
"No wrong answers — curious what everyone's experience
has been." Keep the post under 150 words.

------------------------------------------------------------

38. Launch Announcement Post — New Product or Feature

Write a social media launch announcement post for [NEW
PRODUCT/FEATURE NAME] by [YOUR BRAND]. The post will go
on [PLATFORM, e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or
all three]. Provide platform-specific versions. The
product/feature is [DESCRIPTION — what it does and who
it is for]. The key messaging points are: [POINT 1],
[POINT 2], [POINT 3]. Structure each version as: (1)
An exciting but not over-the-top opening — avoid "We are
thrilled to announce..." and instead lead with what this
means for the user: "You asked for [THING]. We built it."
(2) A 2-3 sentence description of what is new and why it
matters. (3) One specific example of how it works or what
it enables. (4) A CTA tailored to the platform — [CTA,
e.g., "Link in bio," "Comment for early access," or "Try
it free at [URL]"]. For Twitter/X, keep it under 280
characters. For LinkedIn, write 4-6 short paragraphs. For
Instagram, write both a short and long caption option.
Include relevant hashtags for each platform.

------------------------------------------------------------

39. Behind-the-Scenes Post — Build Authenticity

Write a behind-the-scenes social media post for [YOUR
BRAND/COMPANY] that gives followers a peek into [BTS
TOPIC, e.g., how a product is made, a day in the founder's
life, the office/workspace, a team meeting, or the process
behind a recent decision]. The post should build
authenticity and human connection without feeling staged.
Provide versions for [PLATFORM(S)]. Structure: (1) A
casual, "real" opening — think "messy desk, real talk"
energy, not "Here is an exclusive behind-the-scenes look
at our innovative process." Example opening: "This is
what [TIME, e.g., 6 AM on launch day] actually looks like
for us." (2) Share [NUMBER, e.g., 2-3] specific, honest
details about what is shown — the good and the imperfect.
(3) Connect it to the brand's mission or values without
being preachy: "This is why we [VALUE, e.g., obsess over
quality, keep our team small, or test everything 10
times]." (4) A question or invitation for followers to
share their own BTS: [ENGAGEMENT QUESTION]. Keep the tone
genuine, slightly informal, and human.

------------------------------------------------------------

40. User-Generated Content Prompt — Encourage Customer Posts

Write a social media post from [YOUR BRAND] that
encourages customers to create and share their own content
featuring [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. The post should make
customers WANT to participate — not feel like they are
doing free marketing for you. Structure: (1) Lead with the
community — "We love seeing how you [USE CASE, e.g., style
our pieces, use our tools, transform your spaces]." Share
or reference 1-2 examples of great UGC that has already
been posted (or describe hypothetical examples). (2)
Explain the prompt or challenge clearly: [UGC PROMPT,
e.g., "Show us your workspace setup featuring [PRODUCT],"
"Share your before-and-after using [PRODUCT]," or "Tell us
your [PRODUCT] story in 3 sentences"]. (3) Include the
specific hashtag to use: [BRANDED HASHTAG]. (4) Mention
the incentive: [INCENTIVE, e.g., "We'll feature our
favorites on our page," "Win a $100 gift card — winner
chosen Friday," or "Every post earns you loyalty points"].
(5) Provide an example post that customers can use as a
template. Make sharing feel fun and low-pressure. Include
a reminder of any terms or rules.

41. Long-Form Sales Page — Full Structure

Write a long-form sales page for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
priced at [PRICE] targeting [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Follow
this proven sales page structure: (1) Pre-headline — a
one-line qualifier: "For [AUDIENCE] who [SITUATION]."
(2) Headline — a bold promise of transformation. (3)
Opening story or hook (3-4 paragraphs) — paint the
"before" picture vividly. Describe the pain of [CORE
PROBLEM] using specific, sensory details your audience
will recognize. (4) Agitate — expand on the consequences
of not solving the problem: [CONSEQUENCE 1], [CONSEQUENCE
2]. (5) Introduce the solution — present [YOUR PRODUCT]
as the bridge from pain to promise. (6) Features and
benefits section — list [NUMBER] features, each with a
"which means..." benefit translation. (7) Social proof
block — testimonials, stats, media mentions. (8) Objection
handling — address [TOP 3 OBJECTIONS]. (9) Guarantee —
[GUARANTEE TYPE AND DURATION]. (10) Price anchoring —
compare the price to [COMPARISON, e.g., the cost of not
solving the problem, or the price of alternatives]. (11)
Final CTA with urgency. Write the complete copy for each
section — this should be a full, publishable sales page.

------------------------------------------------------------

42. Objection-Handling Copy — Overcome Buyer Resistance

Write objection-handling copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
that addresses the [NUMBER, e.g., 5] most common reasons
prospects do not buy. The objections are: [OBJECTION 1,
e.g., "It's too expensive"], [OBJECTION 2, e.g., "I don't
have time to learn a new tool"], [OBJECTION 3, e.g., "I'm
not sure it will work for my industry"], [OBJECTION 4,
e.g., "I need to get approval from my team"], [OBJECTION
5, e.g., "I've been burned by similar products before"].
For each objection, write: (1) an empathetic
acknowledgment that validates the concern (never dismiss
it), (2) a reframe that shifts perspective — e.g., "The
question isn't whether you can afford it — it's whether
you can afford to keep [LOSING/WASTING] [SPECIFIC COST]
every month," (3) a proof point — a testimonial snippet,
stat, or case study that directly counters the objection,
and (4) a micro-CTA that lowers the barrier — e.g., "Try
it free for 14 days and decide with real data, not
guesswork." These can be used on sales pages, in email
sequences, or as sales enablement content.

------------------------------------------------------------

43. Scarcity & Urgency Framework — Ethical FOMO

Write conversion copy using ethical scarcity and urgency
for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE/OFFER]. The offer is [OFFER
DETAILS, e.g., a limited-time bundle, early-bird pricing,
a cohort-based course with limited seats, or a seasonal
promotion]. The scarcity element is [SCARCITY TYPE, e.g.,
"Only 50 spots available," "Price increases to [FULL
PRICE] on [DATE]," or "Bonus [ITEM] included only for
the first 100 buyers"]. Write copy for: (1) A sales page
urgency bar or banner (one impactful sentence + countdown
reference), (2) An email subject line + opening paragraph
that creates urgency without being manipulative — explain
WHY the scarcity exists (e.g., limited capacity, seasonal
pricing, exclusive batch), (3) A social media post
announcing the deadline, and (4) A "last chance" email
sent [TIME, e.g., 24 hours] before the deadline closes.
Important guidelines: never use fake scarcity, never imply
false deadlines, and never create panic — instead, help
the prospect make a confident, informed decision faster.
Frame urgency as a service: "We want you to have the
information you need to decide before [DEADLINE]."

------------------------------------------------------------

44. Storytelling Sales Copy — Narrative Conversion

Write sales copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] using a
storytelling approach. The story should follow [STORY
TYPE, e.g., "the founder's journey," "a customer
transformation," or "the origin of the product"]. The
protagonist is [PROTAGONIST, e.g., the founder, a
specific customer persona, or the product itself as a
character]. Map the story to a classic narrative arc:
(1) The Ordinary World — what life was like before,
including [SPECIFIC RELATABLE DETAIL]. (2) The Inciting
Incident — the moment that made the protagonist realize
something had to change: [INCIDENT]. (3) The Struggle —
failed attempts, wasted money, frustration with [FAILED
ALTERNATIVES]. (4) The Discovery — how [YOUR PRODUCT]
entered the picture (keep this natural, not infomercial-
like). (5) The Transformation — specific, measurable
results: [RESULT 1], [RESULT 2], [RESULT 3]. (6) The

them into the same transformation. Write this as a

live on a sales page, long-form ad, or email sequence.

Write guarantee and risk-reversal copy for [YOUR PRODUCT/
SERVICE]. The guarantee type is [GUARANTEE, e.g., 30-day
money-back guarantee, 90-day satisfaction guarantee,
lifetime warranty, or results-based guarantee]. Create:
(1) A guarantee section headline that feels bold and
confident, such as "Try It Risk-Free" or "Our [TIME]
'Love It or Leave It' Guarantee." (2) A 3-4 sentence
guarantee description that explains the terms clearly
and simply — no fine print language. Be specific about
what the customer should do if they want a refund: [REFUND
PROCESS, e.g., "Email us at [EMAIL]. No hoops. No
questions asked. Full refund within 48 hours."]. (3) A
paragraph explaining WHY you offer this guarantee — what
it says about your confidence in the product. Frame it as:
"We can offer this because [REASON, e.g., 97% of our
customers stay, our product works, we believe in earning
your business every month]." (4) An optional "anti-
guarantee" line for products where overuse of the
guarantee might attract bad-faith users — a gentle,
honest framing of who this product is (and is not) for.

------------------------------------------------------------

46. Product Comparison Copy — Your Product vs. Status Quo

Write sales copy that compares [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE] to
the status quo — the way your [TARGET AUDIENCE] is
currently solving the problem without your product. This
is NOT a competitor comparison; it is [YOUR PRODUCT] vs.
doing nothing, using spreadsheets, hiring manually, or
cobbling together free tools. Structure as a two-column
comparison: "Without [YOUR PRODUCT]" vs. "With [YOUR
PRODUCT]." Include [NUMBER, e.g., 6] comparison points
covering: time spent, cost, frustration level, quality
of results, scalability, and [CUSTOM COMPARISON POINT].
For each row, the "without" column should be specific
and painfully relatable (not strawman arguments), and
the "with" column should be concrete and provable.
Below the comparison, write a 2-3 sentence paragraph
that summarizes the total impact — e.g., "That is
[NUMBER] hours saved per week, [DOLLAR AMOUNT] in
reduced costs, and significantly less [PAIN POINT]. All
for [PRICE/MONTH]." End with a CTA.

------------------------------------------------------------

47. Bundle Offer Copy — Package Multiple Products

Write sales copy for a bundle offer from [YOUR BRAND]
that packages [NUMBER] products/services together:
[PRODUCT 1 + INDIVIDUAL PRICE], [PRODUCT 2 + INDIVIDUAL
PRICE], [PRODUCT 3 + INDIVIDUAL PRICE]. The bundle price
is [BUNDLE PRICE] (a savings of [SAVINGS AMOUNT OR
PERCENTAGE]). Structure the copy as: (1) Bundle headline
— frame it as a curated package, not a clearance dump.
Example: "The Complete [OUTCOME] Kit" or "Everything you
need to [ACHIEVE GOAL] — in one package." (2) For each
product in the bundle, write a 2-3 sentence description
focused on what it contributes to the overall outcome.
Connect them: "Product A does [X], Product B handles [Y],
and Product C covers [Z] — together, they give you
[COMPLETE OUTCOME]." (3) Price anchoring — show the
individual prices stacked up, then reveal the bundle
price. (4) A "Who is this for?" section — describe the
ideal buyer in 2-3 sentences. (5) A CTA with urgency
if the bundle is time-limited: [DEADLINE OR AVAILABILITY].

------------------------------------------------------------

Write complete sales copy for a limited-time offer on
[YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]. The offer is [OFFER DETAILS, e.g.,
40% off for 72 hours, free bonus with purchase this week,
or early-bird pricing before [DATE]]. The reason for the
promotion is [REASON, e.g., anniversary sale, seasonal
clearance, product launch celebration, or holiday event].
Create copy for the following touchpoints: (1) Sales page
banner — one punchy sentence + deadline. (2) Dedicated
offer page — headline, 3-paragraph body covering what the
offer is, why it exists, and what happens when it expires,
plus CTA. (3) Announcement email — subject line (3
options), preview text, and full email body. (4) Reminder
email (sent [TIME] before deadline) — shorter, more urgent
tone, addressing procrastinators directly. (5) Social
media post — [PLATFORM] version. All copy should maintain
a consistent voice and reference the same deadline:
[EXPIRATION DATE/TIME + TIMEZONE]. Ensure the "why" behind
the offer is clear — customers are skeptical of discounts
without a reason.

------------------------------------------------------------

49. Webinar/Event Registration Copy — Drive Signups

Write registration page and promotional copy for a
[EVENT TYPE, e.g., live webinar, virtual workshop,
masterclass, or AMA session] titled "[EVENT TITLE]"
hosted by [HOST NAME + CREDENTIALS]. The event covers
[TOPIC] and is designed for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. The date
and time is [DATE + TIME + TIMEZONE]. Create: (1)
Registration page copy — headline (promise-driven, not
just the event title), sub-headline, a "What you'll
learn" section with [NUMBER, e.g., 3-5] specific bullet
points (each should be a desirable outcome, not a vague
topic), a "Who this is for" section, host bio (2-3
sentences positioned as credibility), and a registration
CTA button + what they get after registering (e.g.,
calendar invite, prep materials, replay access). (2)
Promotional email — to be sent [TIME] before the event.
Subject line, body that sells the event's value, and a
strong CTA. (3) Social media announcement — [PLATFORM]
version with key details and registration link reference.

join link and one compelling reason to show up live.

------------------------------------------------------------

50. Order Confirmation Upsell Copy — Post-Purchase

Write order confirmation email copy for [YOUR BRAND] that
confirms the purchase of [PRODUCT NAME] and includes a
strategic upsell. Structure: (1) Order confirmation
section — warm thank-you message, order summary with
[PRODUCT], [PRICE], and [ORDER NUMBER PLACEHOLDER], and
estimated delivery or access details. Keep this section
clean and functional — the customer needs to see their
order info first. (2) Transition to upsell — after the
order details, add a clear visual separator and a section
like "One more thing..." or "Customers who bought
[PRODUCT] also love..." (3) Upsell product section —
introduce [UPSELL PRODUCT] with a 2-3 sentence pitch
focused on how it complements the original purchase.
Include [UPSELL PRICE] and a [SPECIAL OFFER, e.g.,
"Add this to your order in the next 30 minutes and save
20%"]. (4) Social sharing invitation — "Excited about
your purchase? Share it: [PRE-WRITTEN TWEET/POST
TEMPLATE]." (5) Support footer — "Questions about your
order? Reply to this email or contact [SUPPORT CHANNEL]."
The upsell should feel like a helpful recommendation, not
a cash grab. Test tone: read it aloud and ask, "Would I
be annoyed to receive this right after buying?"
