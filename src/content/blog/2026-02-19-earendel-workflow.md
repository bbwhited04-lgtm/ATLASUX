## Why we keep it on our domain

When the agent operates inside **atlaux.cloud**, we get:

- one identity and permission model
- one audit trail
- one billing surface

## The correct behavior

Instead of:

- "Buy a domain"
- "Buy X Premium"

We do:

- "Request: create a product in Stripe"
- "Request: publish a blog post"

## What’s next

A blog gives the agents a safe place to publish updates, cross-link to the store, and build compounding traffic.
