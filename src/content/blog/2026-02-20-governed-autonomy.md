## The goal

We want agents that **ship real work** without turning into a runaway demo.

That means a simple operating pattern:

- **Think → Propose → Approve → Execute → Audit**

## Guardrails that keep things safe

1. **No external purchases by default** (domains, subscriptions, ads)
2. **All spending is approval-gated** unless it’s inside a tiny auto-spend zone
3. **Every action writes to the audit ledger** (even $0 actions)

## What this enables

- Routine agents can do routine work.
- Exec agents can approve higher-risk actions.
- The system stays understandable enough for your grandmother.
