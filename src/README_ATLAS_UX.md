# Atlas UX - Standalone AI Employee

## 🌟 Vision

**Atlas UX** is a Windows 11 desktop application that transforms your PC into a **standalone AI employee** - combining the capabilities of Sintra AI, Notion, Gumloop, n8n, Zapier, and Lindy into one powerful, locally-running AI agent.

Atlas operates as your **personal AI worker** that lives on your PC, handling file management, content creation, social media automation, customer relationship management, and learning from your workflows - all secured by Neptune, the AI security control system.
